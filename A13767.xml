            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Xcommunication beeing the higheſt cenſure of all Eccleſiaſticall power, from which the other two of Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Croſſe with all ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and profitable ceremonies doe naturally ariſe; and the lawfulnes and neceſſity of theſe latter depending for the moſt part vpon the former: I haue placed the ſame in the forefront (as it were) of thoſe many battels and encounters, which by all kind of people almoſt in this complayning and murmuring age haue beene made againſt them all, but eſpecially againſt the trueth, power and vſe of excommunication. Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the name and nature thereof, I haue firſt of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to define after this manner: Namely (as the word expoundeth it ſelfe) Excommunication in the moſt generall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19012:11"/> ſenſe and acception thereof is nothing els but a ſeparation from ſome common benefite, of which any formerly haue beene,<note place="margin">Excommunicatio a communi bono ſeparatio.</note> or otherwiſe might haue been partakers: which is the common receiued definition by the Schooles and Canons. Which being ſomewhat too generall for our purpoſe, after certaine diuiſions of theſe larger termes, wee hope at the length to compriſe the full ſumme and ſubſtance thereof in as ſhort a compaſſe as ſo great a matter may be. Theſe common benefites and priuiledges therefore enioyed in this life, being either Eccleſiaſticall or Ciuill; this terme of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath beene alwaies by all ſufficient writers reſtrained to thoſe ſpeciall graces and fauours, which belong properly to the Church: and ſo this cenſure is to be defined accordingly, to be a debarring and ſeparation from the Church: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being either viſible, or inuiſible, the trueth and nature of this excommunication muſt be in like manner examined and diſtinguiſhed to be a ſeparation from the viſible or inuiſible Church. Of which diſtinction ſundry reaſons may be giuen, which briefly may be compriſed in theſe two poſitions, from which many more particulars may eaſily be collected: firſt, that the knowledge, order, and proceeding in either of theſe kindes are very much differing; both in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cenſuring, accuſing, or offending, as alſo of the defaults and puniſhments thereunto belonging: the one being alwaies certaine after one manner, becauſe God (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well obſerueth) who is the high Iudge in that priuy Court, doth ſee all things euermore as they are, and iudgeth accordingly by his preſent mercy and preſent iuſtice: taking all actions and perſons as he findeth them, and ſo his word and miniſtry thereof, with all other meanes belonging to this Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, proceed by the ſame order and degree: the other very variable (from the viſible Church) and vncertaine,<note place="margin">Primo ſecundum praeſcientiam: <hi>2.</hi> Cauſam. <hi>3.</hi> Operationem. <hi>4.</hi> retributionem ſol. <hi>2047.</hi>
                  </note> taking knowledge, and giuing order for perſonall cauſes according to particular allegations and proofes (as they ſay): which <hi>Hugo de ſanct:</hi> in his booke <hi>de Sacramentis legis naturalis &amp; ſcriptae,</hi> doeth more largely expreſſe making foure kindes of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19012:11"/> iudgements. Secondly, becauſe one and the ſelfe ſame perſon may be admitted and allowed for a communicant in the one, which happily hath no intereſt nor fellowſhip in the other: and ſo contrarily the ſame perſons may by courſe and order of lawes and proceeding in ſome caſes be remoued from ſome part of the viſible Church, which keepe their place firme and ſure in the inuiſible, as 1. <hi>Timothy Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe.</hi> 24. and 2. <hi>Samuel Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>verſe.</hi> 7. is plainely auouched that God ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not as man ſeeth, and that ſome mens ſinnes goe before vnto iudgement, and ſome follow after. Now this Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from the inuiſible Church is onely infallibly known and exerciſed by God, who alone knoweth who are his. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 2. verſ. 19.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19012:12"/> and ſupply the Kings place and perſon in any of the ſame. And thus much briefly of this firſt kinde of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which reſpecteth indifferently all kindes of people that haue ſoules to be ſaued: and may, yea ought to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all places where any true miniſter is found, albeit there be no order or power eſtabliſhed according to the nature of a viſible Church, or other ordered gouernment whatſoeuer: For ſo is the nature of the other excommunication which wee made to be from the viſible Church; wherein alwayes is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome company liuing vnder forme of outward go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, by which lawes may be made and enacted for this, or at the leaſt ſome other kinde of ſeparation from the ſame; for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of a company to be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as from which that inceſtuous perſon was to be remoued by his owne cenſure: which alſo may appeare by all other ſuch ſeparations which euer haue beene read of, or are as yet practiſed in the world: wherein by ſome kind of power eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt ſome company liuing vnder gouernement (be it of one kind or other) certaine perſons haue beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded oftentimes (according to the diſcretion of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof) from the face and fellowſhip of ſome viſible Church: Which alſo according to the cauſes and diuers kinds of operation, and proceeding by or againſt any, this kinde of excommunication muſt againe be diuided into that which by violence without cauſe, and againſt all order and reaſon is oftentimes denounced: and that which vpon iuſt cauſe, or by ſome kinde of order at the leaſt is commenced and executed for the ſeparation of any from the viſible Church; the firſt whereof may be called <hi>excommunicatio violentiae;</hi> ſuch as were exerciſed by Tyrants againſt many a true member both of the viſible and inuiſible Church: the other not vnfitl termed <hi>excommunicatio ordinis,</hi> in which by ſome orderly proceeding and vnder ſome courſe of Lawe and conſtitutions iuſt or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt any are remoued from any ſuch company and priuiledges belonging thereunto: which alſo being as all iudgements are as the Schooles diſtinguiſh them, vſurped or defiled and tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19012:13"/> with ſome in iuſtice and wrong, or els direct and regulated according to trueth and equity: ſo likewiſe is this <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio ordinis</hi> whereby good <hi>Ieremie</hi> and our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. were by ſuch orders (as thoſe times did afford <hi>Abſtentes</hi> (as the word in <hi>Ieremie</hi> importeth) and debarred, at the leaſt from many priuiledges of that Church and time (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

According to the vſe of this greate cenſure by all Chriſtian Churches in the world. Which vpon the aſſiſtance at the laſt of Chriſtian magiſtracy, and by their owne ſpeciall decrees and conſtitutions thereabout, haue extended the power of this cenſure to the debarring of thoſe that are ſeparated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from many common priuiledges, whereof the ciuill eſtate maketh them otherwiſe partakers: as appeareth by many ciuil conſtitutions and ſtatute Lawes in force at this preſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, <hi>de excommunicato capiendo,</hi> and ſuch like to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For which cauſe this excommunication by order as we haue termed it for the better ſetting downe the true nature of it, muſt once againe be diuided into that which is meerly ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, as proceeding onely and wholly from that power of the keyes which are giuen to the Church, for the ruling and ſauing of ſoules; or els into that which is ciuill (abuſiuely ſo called and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as we ſay) or laſtly, partly eccleſiaſtical and partly ciuill; according to which are moſt proceedings therein for the outward gouernement of any Church at this day. That which is called eccleſiaſticall is ſo wholly eſtated in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19012:13"/> the perſons of Church gouernours, as that if there were no ciuill Magiſtrate in the world, yet would and ought they to claime and ſhew their authority and power: if according to the true ends and vſes thereof (hereafter more particularly to be ſet downe) the Church ſhall iudge it fit or neceſſary ſo to be awarded.<note place="margin">Author of late aſſertions for Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> And no ciuill power hath any more to doe with it, then (as the lateſt exceptor and pleader himſelfe againſt many things therein confeſſeth and proueth by the authority of Biſhop <hi>Horne</hi> and Doctor <hi>Bilſon,</hi> both reuerend fathers of one Sea in our Church) it hath to doe with making miniſters, conſecrating Churches, <hi>immediate making of Church Canons</hi> for doctrine, &amp; caſes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience adminiſtration of the word and Sacraments, and ſuch like,<note place="margin">In the prefaces to certaine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions made in Henry 8. and Elizabeth their raignes.</note> which <hi>ſome princes of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and all other wiſely poſſeſſed with the trueth of theſe matters, haue euermore diſclaimed. Howbeit for the other which concerne firſt the bodies, and outward eſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whatſoeuer of any, and ſecondarily and conſequently the ſoule and inward man, and ſo alſo reſpect for the moſt part the outward peace of the common ſtate both eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ciuill, they all muſt haue their conſideration, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and proper place accordingly, as proceeding firſt from ciuill power, may be intended or remitted, continued, ſuſpended, or changed, and ſometimes exerciſed or inhibited by ciuill magiſtrates, ſoueraigne or ſubordinate. Of which ſort I make all temporall puniſhments, commutation of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, outward ſhame, and all other bodily afflictions (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of notwithſtanding that of being giuen ouer to Satan, ſome haue made one,<note place="margin">

Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 5. The difference and true diſtinction whereof may appeare by theſe ſpeciall notes: firſt that Eccleſiaſticall excommunication and all things concurring thereunto, ſo farre foorth as they are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eccleſiaſticall, concerne the ſoule and the meanes to recouer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19012:14"/> any ſecure or deſperate ſinner, and withall to preſerue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the whole Church from any further annoyance, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall infection, or any kind of preiudice thereby: but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect firſt the body and outward man, and afterward happily are made profitable and appliable to the ſoules of any. Secondly, that which we call, for better order and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake, ciuill <hi>haue</hi> their ground and originall (whatſoeuer they are) from the other power which is called ciuill magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as the other touching the ſoule, the inward and ſpirituall ſeruice of God, the peace of conſcience and ſuch like, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto this cenſure, proceede from the rites and inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that other order called prieſthood, power of keyes, eccleſiaſticall magiſtracy, or what els beſides it be called, ſwaruing not from the trueth of the matter it ſelfe: which for it part muſt alwayes doe that which belongeth thereunto, in this and all other offices, although there were no Chriſtian Magiſtrate in the world; and doth alſo exerciſe the ſame (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they ſee it moſt fit and correſpondent to the ends aboue named) in all places, where the foote of violence from any part of the ſecular power incombreth not, but rather (as they ought to kiſſe the Sunne in that one ſenſe and behalfe) proteſt and maintaine the rights, power and priuiledges of the ſame. Thirdly, thoſe proceedings herein which are meerly ciuil, or mixt ſometimes of both, according to their ſeuerall ends, authors, and originals, doe principally, and for the moſt part, reſpect the common policy of the whole State, and that which is Ciuil as well and more particulary many times, as that which is Eccleſiaſticall, albeit they ought to agree in all things together, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twinnes. All which might be ſhewed in the manifold particulars, which in the vſe of this cenſure, haue been added, partly by the ciuill Magiſtrate; and further inuented by the immediate Gouernours, vnder the allowance of the chiefe magiſtrate of ſeuerall Churches, for the better ſtrengthning, and more orderly and profitable executing this or any other cenſure, which any iudicious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may referre euery one (as they are not vnknown, by reaſon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19012:14"/> of their common practiſe in the world) to their proper place, and one of thoſe three heads of this our laſt diuiſion. To which I deſire this one thing to be adioyned, before I come to the more particular definition of this Excommunication: namely, that albeit this cenſure doth properly and euermore of right, belong to the power of the Church and immediate gouernment of ſoules: yet can no ſuch power exerciſe any part of outward gouernment, or more publique adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoeuer, within the territories and dominions of any ciuill magiſtracy, without the ſpeciall good allowance or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, at the leaſt, of the chiefe magiſtrate there, which in all places of ſetled and well ordered gouernment, appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the ciuill power: which God in the example and type of <hi>Iudah,</hi> among the tribes hath made the onely lawe-giuer. Inſomuch as no due execution of any other their owne moſt proper proceedings, can bee well performed without their helpe and aſſiſtance: which cauſed the due vſe of this cenſure to be ſo rarely, and indeed weakly exerciſed in the primitiue Church, and many other Churches of later times, before ciuil magiſtrates were chriſtned, or this ciuill power did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the protection of the Church, or at leaſt gaue way and liberty for the full execution of all Eccleſiaſticall power; which hath beene very much curbed and ſcanted by moſt Chriſtian Princes in the world. Much leſſe doe we arrogate any ſecular power and command, to be originally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the perſons or ſtates meerly eccleſiaſticall, albeit one and the ſelfe ſame man or ſtate, may very lawfully, and ought ſometimes neceſſarily to be armed and furniſhed with them both (as <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe learnedly ſheweth,<note place="margin">In Epistola re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſiua ad Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthonem: Et in poſtilla ad Epiphaniam de Magis.</note> and elſewhere we haue examined, that as the ciuill magiſtrate ſometimes hath been a prieſt, ſo contrarily may Gods miniſter be a king, or of any other electiue dignity: the ſame man, but not the ſame perſon, which are diſtinguiſhed euermore, but may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur both in one ſubiect) but that the enacting of lawes,<note place="margin">Bodin. de repub. &amp; in Method<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Alwayes prouided that the eſſentiall and mayne points expreſſed in the word, or the neceſſary conſequents belonging to any perſon cauſe, or calling in theſe Eccleſiaſticall adminiſtrations, be in no part aboliſhed, interrupted or diminiſhed; which is all that we challenge in this Excommunication, or any other ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, priuiledge, or cenſure from any ciuill magiſtrate in the world. The ſumme and definition whereof, according to the premiſes (I meane this Excommunication from the viſible Church, by order of wholſome Lawes eccleſiaſticall or ciuil, according to the true nature thereof commaunded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the word of God) may for our better proceeding to the points that follow,<note place="margin">Definitio Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicationis a viſibili eccleſia.</note> be thus ſet downe. Namely, to be that cenſure of the Church, which proceeding from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the keyes, is awarded againſt notorious offenders vnder any forme or meanes, by thoſe perſons onely whome any Church ſhall thinke beſt to depute and aſſigne to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all cauſes deſeruing the ſame, and to giue ſentence according to the nature thereof againſt any perſons offending therein. Which although in regard of the extent thereof, and quality of the crimes and perſons offending and incurring this cenſure, it hath beene diuided or rather diſtinguiſhed by ſome ſuch circumſtantiall differences of time, longer or leſſer while, places, of and in the Church or Churchyards, or ſuch like; yet for ſumme and ſubſtance (I hold them all one,) as by the true ends &amp; ſcope of all thoſe kinds afore named, or at any

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ends therefore of all thoſe kinds of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which haue beene recited in the former Chapter (as appertayning any way to the Church power and authority) concerne either the common good, or auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any euill and imminent daunger in any particular Church: which by ſuffering any notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vncenſured, or ſcandalouſly to reſt among them, might by euill example or further infection be much annoyed, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſubuerted: or els the priuate duty and care the Church, sa a louing mother, &amp; the miniſters thereof their ſpirituall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ought to haue, for the regaining and recouering any from their irrepentance, and more ſpeciall ſoule ſinnes, as alſo by true confeſſion of ſome occaſions and occurrents thereunto, vpon their receiuing againe into the Church, to preſerue them from further daungers: and to preſcribe them remedies and directions for afterward. And indeede more good is like to be done toward the moſt part of ſinners vpon their confeſſions and abſolutions after theſe cenſures, then we ſee come to paſſe, or likely to be effected, by our ordinary and generall preaching. The common ground of all which may be obſerued, eſpecially in the latter inuentions for bodily and more ſenſible puniſhments, to haue proceeded from the ſtrange corruption and fleſhly mindes of all mankind for the moſt part, with whome all other meanes of exhortations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19012:16"/> reprehenſions, promiſes, or threatnings for the time to come, and ſuch like will little preuaile, except ſome preſent, ſenſible, temporall afflictions, inward or outward, be adioyned thereunto: and therefore not onely meanes of griefe, feare, and ſhame, but other alſo more neere and outward pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments vpon their goods, bodies, and good names for euer, haue beene deuiſed and appointed, to driue them to confeſſe and leaue their ſinnes, and by the affliction of the fleſh (as ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth) in what kind ſoeuer, to recouer and ſaue the ſoule, in the day of Chriſt Ieſus his iudgement: wherein the Church dealeth as God himſelfe is wont with hard hearted and irrepentant ſinners, whome when all other meanes faile, he afflicteth for no other end but their owne ſaluation, with many inward and outward plagues and iudgements. In all which temporall and outward afflictions, this one thing ought euermore to be regarded by thoſe that haue the awarding of them, that ſuch particular meanes in this kind may euer bee applied, as whereby the offenders might more ſenſibly be touched: and not to puniſh the richer ones by the purſe, which they little regard; and the poorer with ſhame and bodily cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, which they are wel hardned to indure: but rather contrariwiſe; that ſo at the leaſt, they may be brought into order of outward gouernment, if not to the inward reforming of themſelues, and ſo by true and vnfained confeſſion to God and man, to be reſtored againe to the inuiſible Church: which all the parts and kinds of theſe latter excommunications aime at, and ſerue vnto. For ſo indeed this confeſſion, and abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereupon, is one of the chiefe and true ends of this the greateſt cenſure of excommunication, and all the meanes and parts thereof; as might appeare by thoſe hard places in the 6. and 10. to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the 18. of <hi>Matthew</hi> (if they be throughly looked into, and well compared together) as alſo by the practiſes of the Iewes themſelues, to the which ſome of thoſe places at the leaſt are referred, and by the ſame (as the practiſes of thoſe times) for the moſt part to be expounded: who were not only armed for their Eccleſiaſticall eſtate with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19012:16"/> great authority, but had further power to inflict corporall puniſhments, which the Romanes themſelues would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abrogate, nor much alter.

Howſoeuer in the caſes before named, they whom ſuch matters do concerne (the Gouernours in any part of the viſible Church) are taught and enioyned by the places before cited, to keepe this order and decorum; becauſe otherwiſe there would be no order or diſtinction at all, but the bloud of Chriſt together with this cenſure, and all other holy admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations would infinitely be prophaned of all deſperate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; who would make no more of this matter, but to ſinne and be abſolued againe: which were not onely troubleſome

And indeed ſo farre is this place, or any of the other before alledged, or any where to be found in the old or newe Teſtament, from giuing any ſignes or directions to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, or Church in generall to take knowledge, or giue iudgement of any to haue committed the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, as that (I thinke) no humane cenſure hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had any warrant or permiſſion from any part of Gods word ſo much as to inquire, or to take any knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; being only known to God himſelfe as aboueſaid, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone knoweth who they be that will continue in finall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency vnto the end.

Firſt, how farre this cenſure (as it is Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call) may extend it ſelfe; being, as ſome merry gentlemen and quaint Lawyers of latter time haue in reproche thereof caſt foorth, a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe gulfe, which they nor any other could euer ſound, nay yet the originall and ground from whence both it and all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall power do proceed, eſpecially as they are exerciſed now adayes in moſt places of the world. To which I anſwer, firſt, that if they could be as wel contented to giue vnto Chriſt that which is his by the power of the ſpirituall ſword (which ſhould cauſe this acknowledgement) as they are enforced by temporal Lawes and power to giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is due vnto him, they would neuer occupy their heads, and tongues with ſuch queſtions ſauoring ſtrongly of diſdain and enuie, if not palpable ignorance, in this cleere light of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19012:18"/> the Goſpell: for in a word this power of theirs is as well from aboue as any other ſubordinate power vnder Chriſt, who being the great Biſhop of ſoules, hath appointed his holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and annoynted them with ſpeciall grace and power for the gouernement of ſoules by all thoſe outward meanes of diſpenſing the word in any kind or manner, giuing the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, admitting into the Church vpon confeſſion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the true faith, and ſhutting out for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the ſame, abſoluing and receiuing them againe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repentance profeſſed, and ſuch like in any of the parts of this Excommunication beſides, which God hath made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this function (as hath beene aboue declared.) And ſo not only that ſpeciall power and commiſſion to deale with the conſcience and inward man in all matters appertayning to the viſible Church, is appropriated to this miniſtery: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular annointed with the leaſt part of that holy oile, but alſo a kind of externall power and iuriſdiction, properly alſo Eccleſiaſtical, reſpecting all the meanes aboueſayde, and all other things which directly and immediatly concerne the ſoule, and the meanes for the peace, ſafety, and well ordering the ſame in the kingdome of grace, and preparing and fitting them for the kingdome of glory. Inſtance and euident proofe whereof, is affoorded in this one practiſe, for many others, of the primitiue Church: in which theſe Church gouernors only tooke knowledge and care of all thoſe that gaue their names vnto Chriſt, and were thereupon after confeſſion of the faith, admitted into the ranke and order of their <hi>Catecumeni,</hi> and ſo afterward were reckoned in the number of the viſible Church (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſeth of himſelf:) who alſo afterwards falling from that faith, or not liuing worthy of the ſame, after all good meanes vſed (as is ſpecified more particularly by our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. v. 17. and was alwayes in force in the primitiue Church, as by <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. &amp; other places may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and yet perſiſting in that their vnworthineſſe of ſuch a fellowſhip, were returned backe againe by the ſame power of the Church vnto their former eſtate: and were no otherwiſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19012:19"/> accounted of then as if they were Publicans or Heathen: <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. v. 17. that is, ſuch as had nothing to doe with that ſpeciall Church of the Iewes which was the onely Church viſible at that time. The like may be ſayd of all decrees and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made by the immediate gouernours of any particular Church, for the determining of all controuerſies, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scriptures according to the rules of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and their ſpeciall preſcribing meanes and directions to penitents, and ſuch like (as Phyſitians are wont to their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents) and giuing orders for the ſafe keeping of the doctrine of faith and manners, and the preuenting of all things contrary to the ſame, commonly procured by hereticks and ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Wherein alſo that their power for the vrging of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, proceeding from this of Excommunication to all things ſet downe by them not contrary to the generall rules of faith and manners conſiſteth and appeareth (as is further declared in the next treatiſe.) In which reſpect Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gaue ſuch charge in ſo many places vnto <hi>Timothie</hi> for the carefull keeping of that depoſitum and forme of wholſome wordes: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. v. 20.

Albeit in that infancy of the Church in all places there was a great mixing of both powers (as appeareth by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) who called Councels in their owne name, for the better ſtrengthning that their weake ſtate and beginnings, ſtrooke ſome with temporal puniſhments, and with death alſo in ſome caſes: which alſo vntill Chriſtian Magiſtrates did protect and maintayne this power, rights and authority of the Church, was practiſed in many places after the Apoſtles time, whereſoeuer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19012:19"/> the violence of perſecuting tyrantes did not reſtrayne the Church liberty in this behalfe: which is wont, and ſo iuſtly may, yea ought indeede (as well as any other incoporation left vnto it ſelfe) to make Lawes, ordayne Magiſtrates, puniſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and ſuch like, whereby that their ſtate may bee better ordered and preſerued. Howbeit, which in the ſecond place I anſwer and is euermore to bee remembred (according as wee haue alſo obſerued before) no power whatſoeuer properlie belonging to the Church, or els annexed by any meanes thereunto, can be exerciſed in any part of the world, vnder ciuill Magiſtracy, without the authority or good leaue at the leaſt of the commaunders therein: nor any Lawes made or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified without aſſent and leaue of the ciuill power: as vnder which, and from which all other Externall power hath all his outward motion, as the moſt principall members of any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body vnder their proper head: as all Chriſtian Churches doe acknowledge the ciuill magiſtrate in all cauſes ſupreme head and gouernour (howſoeuer that word Head without any ſuch iuſt cauſe (I thinke) hath beene of late miſliked of ſome) euen as many good Popes alſo,<note place="margin">Beda. lib. <hi>1</hi> cap. <hi>23.</hi> de Gregorie Mag: ad Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricium, &amp; lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>18.</hi> Honorius ad Horaolium.</note> before that chayre of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was fully ſeated amongſt them, did call the Emperors of their times, their gracious Lords. And yet notwithſtanding as the other principall parts of the body (the Liuer for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) hath immediate motion and operation from it ſelfe, as wel as that other from the head; and as the inferiour orbes of the Stars and circles of heauen are moued as well by theyr owne naturall courſes as by that generall motion which is obſerued to carry all other with it, and vnder it: ſo is it in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of politique adminiſtrations, Eccleſiaſticall and ciuil, both interchaungeably compared and conſidered together: neither may the proper orders and proceedings of the one be truely ſayde to be any more preiudiciall or contrary to the other, then the Liuer in his proper operations to the heart or head, from which it hath his continuall life and motion: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the God of nature hath in his wiſedome and prouidence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly diſpoſed of them in that general communion (their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties

Firſt therefore they might as well except againſt the miniſtery of the word and Sacraments, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or degrading of miniſters, conſecrating of Churches, and ſuch like many more; which as yet none of theſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor any other durſt diuorce from that holy order and power of Prieſthood (as without any true offence it may bee called) or to make them any way common to any Prince and ciuil power whatſoeuer. Secondly the heart may as well bee arraigned of treaſon againſt the head and whole body, as this power of the keyes, and any particular adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may bee iudged preiudiciall to the ſupremacy of Princes, and ſafety of the whole body, ſtanding quietly of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Ciuil power, and executions ſweetely ioyned and combyned together, vnder any kinde of ſoueraignty, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil Magiſtracy, which is euermore the head of them both. And laſtly, their Lawe and Logicke together very much deceiue them, not onely in making that the cauſe, which is not the cauſe, and things accidentally and by circumſtance ſomtimes euil, to bee ſo euermore, and in their owne nature (which are the vſuall ſallations practiſed by theſe Sophiſters deceiuing themſelues and others thereby:) but alſo (which argueth their greateſt ignorance, or forgetfulneſſe at the leaſt in this point) pleading from that (which is cleane contrary) to argue this encumbring and encountring of Princes iuſt titles and royall dignities, as the proper effect of the ſame. For indeed this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication (eſpecially as it was vſed by thoſe maſters of the Romiſh Church) was one of the greateſt engins &amp; meanes to batter downe the walls and ſtrong holdes of Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prelacy, and power, when Princes and all the world once perceiued that thoſe many Bulls roared for nothing els but to get preies for the filling of their owne bellies, and feeding the ambitious humours of thoſe vſurping and preſumptuous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19012:21"/> Prelates. And for the thing it ſelfe in it owne nature, there is no one thing belonging to Eccleſiaſticall power, or which might poſſibly be inuented in the world, which might ſooner diſtaſt Princes, or any part of the ciuill body, and more likely to withdrawe them from protecting all or any of the Church rightes, then the due execution of this cenſure. In regard whereof, together with theſe confuſed and troubled times (wherewith the Church hath beene and is, for the moſt part, ſtill annoyed and incumbred) the due and conſtant vſe of this Excommunication, eyther hath beene obſerued to haue been ſeldome practiſed in any Church: or els haue the wiſeſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the ſame not thought it fit or conuenient, many times, to drawe out this ſpirituall ſword, and cenſure ſo often as otherwiſe the neceſſity and ſafety of their ſeueral Churches might require. And for the abuſes which proceeded from the perſons to whome this cenſure hath beene at any time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and not from the thing it ſelfe: whereas for want of skill happely and good wiſedome, how and when this ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all phyſicke was to be applyed (as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> himſelfe obſerueth, who had more learning and iudgement, euen in this phyſicke alſo and true diuinity, then hundreds of theſe late pleaders, and from whome this laſt dramme of miſchiefe was drawne into the Pennes and pleas of theſe pettifoggers and promoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) they doe no more argue the vnlawfulneſſe of this power, or diſable the true, wiſe, and round vſe thereof, then if a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe although a golden ſword appointed euermore for the higheſt Iuſtice, ſhould be miſliked, and moſt ſenſeleſly indic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and condemned for that murder, which a foole and mad man had committed by it. To all which kinds of reaſoning and ſuch like obiections and framers of them, I could wiſh better ſkill to conſtrue their Lawe, or choppe our Logicke (as we ſay) then for want of this latter (which with due reuerence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to that graue profeſſion, any may obſerue to bee much wanting in thoſe Scribes, eſpecially when they are out of that their Element, and put a little from their owne pace) to miſſe very much in their right vſe and application of the former,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19012:21"/> and other their riche naturalls and further accompliſhments, wherewith for the moſt part they are well qualified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed: for many Lawyers (as I may ſay truely with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect as aboueſayd) of moſt of them, would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute as well as any if they knew how: and for the laſt pleader of all,<note place="margin">Author of the Aſſertions for Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> who hath beene a great and long practiſer in that bad and blacke Court (by cunning libelling againſt all our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall power and proceedings, and not long ſince hath drawne all his Lawe and Logicke (which I thinke may be put in a little bagge, or at the leaſt weighed in a ſmall ballance) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſlime and froth of his hote and malitious wit to the fortifying of a rotten mud wall reared by another plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der almoſt as bad as himſelfe) I cannot but in holy zeale (I hope) to this good cauſe and moſt holy cenſure of Chriſts Church,<note place="margin">Nichols Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termure.</note> and iuſt indignation againſt all ſuch vnſkilfull refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Eccleſiaſticall abuſes, and wilfull deformers indeede of all good order, crie out with <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and all ſuch enuious ſpirits and deſpitefull lookers vpon any that haue greater guifts and authority then themſelues: Thou, thy Law and thy Logicke periſh together, for they haue no part (I am ſure) nor portion in theſe buſineſſes, and leſſe authority or calling to ſpeake or write againſt any thing poſſible amiſſe therein: and I feare (I may too too truely adde the other) that theyr hearts are not vpright in them, but that vnder colour of calling vppon the vrging and mayntaining of many good Lawes, and conſtitutions amongſt vs, and vnder pretence of tendring Princes ſupremacy (which if any ſhould preſume to breathe or blowe againſt, I wiſh them from my heart breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) to eſtabliſh an yron and Macedonian throne for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vnder which they would ſoone bondage and bring both Medes and Perſians, and the golden head it ſelfe of any kind of gouernment; as al know their intendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who are any way acquainted with their poſitions, reſolutions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about their new diſcipline, which they forſooth call Chriſt his lore and yoke, vnto which all Chriſt his true members muſt ſubmit themſelues. Which indeed is no other (eſpecially
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19012:22"/> as they meane it for this poynt and argument, which wee haue in hand) but the new fangled deuices of their owne diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ambitious ſpirits: as in the examination of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of this firſt obiection, which now followeth, ſhall better and more fully I hope appeare. For vnder that more large queſtion touching the original and due bounds of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, commeth another more ſpeciall and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, very much vrged and delighted in, by many: how far Princes themſelues are ſubiect to this cenſure, or any other perſon or perſons, or whole ſtates ſomtimes of like condition, quality and conſideration: the which being diuerſly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and intended by theſe two late pleaders (the one exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Princes altogether from all and euery part (as it ſeemeth) of this Excommunication, (as may bee gathered by his owne words:) the other vrging, eſpecially herein, the abuſe of it in his conceipt by ſome,<note place="margin">Nichols in his plea for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. pag. 51. &amp; 52.</note> to whome (which he ſo much miſliketh) that is impropriated which in his iudgement ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Miniſters of the Goſpel: and that ſo far foorth (as was obſerued by a graue counſellor of our ſtate, by that which was put vp in petition ſometimes by thoſe innocents his cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents) that by their rules the paſtor of Greenewitch might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſo worthily famous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world in thoſe dayes.

But (leauing them to themſelues) I thus anſwer to the particulars of this obiection as they glance and glide on both ſides of this Excommunication, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the former exceptors and many other, againſt the truth and nature of the ſame: Firſt, that as for that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from the inuiſible Church, whereby any Miniſter pronounceth according to the rules of Gods word, of any, to be in the ſtate of grace or otherwiſe: it and all the parts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it agree as well to the Prince, and any other ſuch like perſon or ſtate, as to any other that hath a ſoule to ſaue, and ſo ſtandeth in neede of faith, repentance, confeſſion, and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neceſſary, requiſite, and tending thereunto: becauſe in Chriſt Ieſus, and matters of ſoules gouernment, Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and ſuch like, there is neither bond nor free, as <hi>Coll.</hi> 3. v. 11. Secondly for that which we call, from the viſible Church, ſo far footth as it is meerely Eccleſiaſticall, euery Prince and Potentate is as wel lyeable vnto it as any other; becauſe the care and charge of their ſoules is no leſſe vpon the gouernors of the Church, but rather much more then for any other: and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19012:23"/> alſo their ſinnes and examples are commonly more infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dangerous then other mens. And laſtly, it were not onely a great profanation of all thoſe holy things dayly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuch polluted and vncleane ſoules, but a greate cruelty alſo and careleſneſſe at the leaſt, in thoſe that ſhould be ſoule-ſauers and phyſitians, to ſuffer any vnder their diet, ordering, and cure to ſurfet themſelues, and ſurcharge their ſoules with new ſinnes of taking by this meanes Gods name in vaine, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting his ſanctuary eating and drinking their owne damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch like: before by confeſſion and true repentance outwardly teſtified, at the leaſt (which is as much as any man can require and diſcerne) they haue diſcharged themſelues of their ould ſinnes as noxious humors in a foule ſtomacke; which eftſoones otherwiſe would break out into many aguiſh hote and cold fits (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth them) of other ſinnes, and dayly ſymptoms of Gods iudgements. Howbeit in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind of Excommunication there are certaine caſes reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">Caſus reſeruati.</note> and ſpeciall rules euermore to be obſerued for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which may fit vs in ſome better and further anſwer to this point. As firſt, that becauſe the ſafety of many, and the common peace of the whole Church is alwayes to be reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preferred before any meanes for the ſaluation of a few, or of the Prince himſelfe, in ſuch times as by the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of ſome Prince, or others of great power, or els ſome whole faction which might breed commotion in the Church or whole ſtate (commonly noted and called by <hi>turbidis tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus</hi>) this cenſure may very well, yea ought to be forborne, as in all other of that nature, which may preiudice, rather then helpe and further the peaceable gouernement of the Church, and ſauing of ſoules in generall. For which ends this cenſure was firſt inuented by God, or man, and all things appertaining thereunto, and wholly are, and ought to be referred. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where the forbearing of this cenſure, or at the leaſt ſome higher degree thereof, may bee perceiued by the wiſedome of the Church to make moſt for the regaining of any, who might otherwiſe haply bee hardned and diſcouraged, if not in ſome
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19012:23"/> tender minded people ſwallowed vp with ſorrow thereby: as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſeemeth to imploy verſ. 22. &amp; 23: commaunding to put this wiſe difference, taking pitty of ſome, and pulling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome out of the fire, according alſo to that generall rule (which may be the ground of both theſe anſwers) 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. v. 10: God hath giuen this power to ſaue, and not to deſtroy: and ſo vpon <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. v. 29. the learned haue obſerued three bad kinds of Excommunication comparatiuely to thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radications there ſpoken of: <hi>Feſtinata, Suſpitioſa, Damnoſa:</hi> which they thus expound (namely) <hi>damnoſa Excommunicatio quando multitudo eſt in cauſa, vel princeps, niſi fuerit cauſa manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta redundans in iniuriam eccleſiae:</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> obſerueth the ſame, <hi>quod aliquandò ſunt tolerandi mali pro pace eccleſiae, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do timetur de ſchiſenate,</hi> adding, <hi>aliud eſt quod docemus, aliud quod ſuſtinemus.</hi> For ſo may this Excommunication be well and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly likened vnto a ſword or phyſick, which are neuer to be vſed but vpon great occaſion: and when thoſe that haue ſkill how to vſe them ſee it fit and needfull, eſpecially for this ſtrongeſt kind of potion (as I may ſo terme it) which onely is to be vſed in deſperate diſeaſes. And therefore the gouernours of the Church &amp; immediate miniſters and awarders of this cenſure, reſpecting with a wiſe eye and foreſight, when this phyſicke and laſt remedy may be profitable &amp; behouefull, obſerue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that milder meanes of more graue and temperate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and increpations to ſerue turne towards ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whome being wiſe (as the prouerb is) a word may be ſufficient, and many times better then this great blowe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication. Which further no immediate miniſter thereof vnder Chriſt priuately or more publickly in any ſtate-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration is bound continually and without reſpect or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to denounce and put in vſe and execution, but as they ſhall find and iudge it moſt profitable for that whole Church wherein they are Iudges and Commiſſioners, or that ſpeciall perſon or perſons who may incur and deſerue the ſame: which being once diſcerned and vpon ſufficient and mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration reſolued vpon, it ought to paſſe againſt all that liue in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19012:24"/> the Church, princes or potentates, as well as others without reſpect of perſons; except onely (which is the laſt reſeruation in this caſe) with ſtrong hand they be openly withſtood, or iuſtly feared ſo to be: which in another kinde was <hi>Dauid</hi> his caſe ſometimes, when in his wiſe foreſight and moſt iuſt griefe and godly indignation withall he cryeth out:<note place="margin">2.

Laſtly (I anſwer to the ſecond part of this grand obiection) that in reſpect of the laſt kind of Excommunication, which we called for diſtinction ſake, Ciuil (ſo far ſoorth as this cenſure hath beene at any time ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned immediatly by ciuill Lawes and authority, or the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of any Church themſelues haue had any delegate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er committed vnto them for that purpoſe) no chiefe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate (howſoeuer he be termed in monarchicall or any other ſtate) is any further ſubiect to it, then as himſelfe who is the fountaine of all externall power, and ſuch kind of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, ſhall thinke good for any iuſt cauſe and reſpect, eyther of his owne good or peace, or well ordering of his ſtate, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe thereunto: as the manner of our Kings of England is (and euer hath beene) in matters of common iuſtice to yeeld themſelues to the order of Lawes, as well as other their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and ſo are many times impleaded in their owne courts; which if they ſhould refuſe, no humane power by Gods word hath any authority to bring them into order, either of any of thoſe Ciuill courts, or thoſe other which for the conſtitutions and proceſſe therein, we haue called Eccleſiaſticall. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion and obiection is framed by the ſelfeſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and ſundry others peruerted rather then inſtructed by theſe maſters (why this cenſure of Excommunication, and the key of all Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction in generall, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to euery miniſter, but made proper and peculiar to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, their Chancellors and Officialls, or any other to whom more improperly in their iudgements it doth appertaine. To which (I anſwer) that ſo far foorth as this Excommunication ſeperateth any from the inuiſible Church, it equally ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to euery miniſter, of what degree and guift ſoeuer: as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19012:24"/> well as the adminiſtration of the word and Sacraments, which are outward meanes in like manner to teſtifie vnto any their communion or ſeparation from the true Catholike Church, which is onely ſeene of God: but for the other two later kinds of Excommunication (which are properly politique, and exerciſed euermore by ſome company liuing vnder forme and order of Lawes, as all other of that nature, they may no more properly or conueniently belong vnto euery miniſter, then that euery Citizen ſhould be Ruler and Magiſtrates at the leaſt in free Citties, or that euery Counſellor or Lawyer ſhould bee Iuſtice of peace, or that euery one ſhould be the maſter, father, or firſt borne: and ſo beare all kind of rule in euery familie.

And had not God himſelfe made this order and difference in all publique and politique proceedings (as by the places aboue named, and many other of the old and newe Teſtament (which we haue elſewhere vſed for the differences and dignities of Miniſters in generall, may appeare) yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience, reaſon and neceſſity would haue inforced the ſame, as we may ſee in all pollitique bodies Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuil, which haue euer beene in the world: which otherwiſe through a generall confuſion, none ruling, nor any obeying, would fall downe of themſelues; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, if euery member were a head, where were the hand, the feete, the ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? &amp;c: euen all without order and difference, a monſtrous confuſion. And therefore theſe men themſelues in their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing and awarding this high cenſure or any part of their new deuiſed pollicy and diſcipline, reduce all ſuch proceedings to Conſiſtorial throne and iuriſdiction, and that in far greater ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty and peremptory vnreuerſeable power, then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer vnder Chriſtian Magiſtracy any lawfull Eccleſiaſticall body doth execute their iuriſdictions and power.

The ſecond reaſon of this neceſſitie of Subſcription, is for the diſcerning and examining how certaine perſons (of whom more ſpeciall care is to be taken) are diſpoſed and affected to the preſent ſtate eſtabliſhed, and the generall proceedings thereof, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (becauſe no ſtate is able to prouide for all particulars they haue ben vſually reduced in our Church to thoſe three (which of all others were adiudged to be moſt needfull, and behooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the ſtate preſent.</p>
               <p>The firſt in regard of that dangerous doctrine, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defection and ſeparation therupon of many a liege ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect otherwiſe againſt the Princes moſt lawfull ſupremacie, that by meanes of this Subſcription, at the leaſt ſuch as might draw others into the like errours, ſhould ſhew their deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a dangerous doctrine and opinion. The ſecond in regard of that Anabaptiſticall fury, which poſſeſſed whole multitudes amongſt vs not long ſince, and raged very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for the time in the minds and practiſes of many, holding &amp; teaching that our orders for Gods ſeruice &amp; ſet formes of prayers, in general (&amp; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not without blaſphemy of the Lords
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19012:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> prayer it ſelfe) were not to be allowed, as being vnfit for theſe times of grace, and much derogatory from thoſe ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, required ſince that fulneſſe of grace, and prerogatiue of the Spirit, and aboundance thereof vpon the Church. For meeting with which inconuenience the ſecond article concerning the book of common prayer, was thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be vrged againſt Browniſme, and all the points and branches thereof: vnto both which the third alſo was found as requiſite and needfull to be adioyned, for the lawfulnes and ſufficiencie of the ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of miniſters amongſt vs, which as yet very many da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerouſly ſtumble at (&amp; indeed is thought to be the onely true and moſt common rocke of offence in this their ſeparation) and that as well in regard of Papiſts which generally hold, that we haue no true miniſtery or Miniſter in England: as alſo of many amongſt the other Anabaptiſticall ſort and faction, that maintaine openly, the making of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be proper to God &amp; the ſpirit, &amp; ſo was ſubiect to no human power, much leſſe to that which our State inueſteth in the Biſhops &amp; Eccleſiaſtical power eſtabliſhed amongſt vs as the immediate meanes vnder God for that purpoſe. Inſomuch as euen vnto this day, the greateſt maiſters of oppoſition to the Biſhops, calling them plants that God neuer planted, and ſuch like, condemne them, and much more others, for nothing ſo much as taking vpon them this power (and which in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and beſt obſeruation in many, is the maine and greateſt rock of offence, hindering the ſubſcription of many at this time) and haue for their parts, made no more of any ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and power giuen them by the Biſhops then (as they haue not ſpared in my hearing, although long ſince, blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay) of a paſport fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a maſter theefe, to paſſe through Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat hole, or ſome ſuch theeuiſh place, or by a bribe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe fauour from an vniuſt and wicked Iudge, there being no other man or meanes allowed by authority for that end and purpoſe: and yet poore men for this point alſo, as well as for all other of doctrine or practiſe, generall or particular, in ſome caſes of conſcience, they allow of a ſorry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany in their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19012:35"/> Presbiters to order miniſters, and determine all other matters as the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnreuerſable in in al things. In regard wherof, &amp; many ſuch like generals &amp; particulars (which might eaſily be added) a man would think it high time &amp; thrice neceſſarie to haue this Subſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the greateſt ſtrictnes &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vrged. Now theſe being the two maine reaſons of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, reſpecting the ſtate in generall, we will conſider of ſome others which concerne the reuerent fathers of the Church, and their ſpeciall requiring the ſame at the hands of any, and then to anſwere to ſome few things obiected to the contrary. Firſt therefore, the common reaſons for ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ſuch as we haue aboue ſhewed, it may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to any equally minded, that the Biſhops being put in truſt by God and man with the gouernement of the Church, and all ſtate occaſions depending thereupon, they do no more herein (whatſoeuer any doe leſſe) then that which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawes of the kingdome, and the chiefe gouernours of our whole ſtate do enioyne them, and require at their hands, and none other. So that in caſe it ſhould at any time fall out (which God forbid) that by reaſon of negligence, or want of due care in looking to theſe things ſo committed vnto them, any ſuch as <hi>Dauids</hi> men were, or worſe, ſhould come ſo neere the Lords annointed, or any part of that caue or compaſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might haue opportunity to cut off the lappe of his coat,<note place="margin">1. Sam. cap. 26. v. 15.16.</note> or take the pot of water from his head (I meane, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late any the leaſt part of that generall order of things eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by him, much more to preiudice or endammage any of his royall prerogatiues) all <hi>Dauids</hi> and others might iuſtly cry alowde to theſe our Abners, that they were very worthy of the greateſt blame. Secondly, did not theſe grand Captaines and commanders aboueſayd for all ſtate proceedings, looke for this care and ſeruice at the Biſhops hands; yet being the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate gouernours of the Church, both their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and godly wiſedome and foreſight could doe no leſſe (except they ſhould become deſperately careleſſe in their ſpeciall charges,<note place="margin">Iud. 18. verſ 7.</note> like vnto thoſe gouernours in Iudges, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19012:35"/> had neither gates nor barres to their townes and Cities.) And ſo not only that turbulent Tribe, but the very runnagates of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and tayles of <hi>Iſraell</hi> (as in <hi>Hoſea</hi> they are called) might not only traiterouſly pierce our beſt and ſtrongeſt Church forces (as they dayly now doe) but alſo enter vpon and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe (which alſo they haue beene very ready and buſie to do) euen their beſt Holds within yea the Maſters and gouernors themſelues: who more eſpecially ſitting at the ſterne ſhould not only without that former care and meanes of preuention, be infinitely moleſted in their owne perſons, and all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; but to their greate hearts griefe often ſee the whole ſhip of their gouernment toſſed vp and downe with contrary windes and waues of diuers and contrary doctrines, and as many differences in ceremoniall and all outward obſeruances, if not to be wracked vpon the manifold dangerous Syrtes and rocks of this later Church-hating, enuying, and robbing age. Thirdly not only the care of the preſent ſtate in generall, and more eſpeciall that of the Church committed vnto them, but charity it ſelfe and due compaſſion of ſo many poore people committed vnto them, eaſily ſeduced and moſt inclinable to this variety in doctrine and profeſſion, doe bind theſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers of the Church to a more ſtrict vrging of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, or any other meanes for the maintaining of vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the one, and conformity in the other.

But for the reaſon it ſelfe we now inſiſt in, it is euident to the eies of all our Engliſh, who without partiality and preiudice doe behold the ſtate of our times, where a man may ſee, for want of exacting this meanes of ſecurity, and preuention againſt the ſame not onely diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of opinions broached and ſcattered in euery place, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtractions thereupon of all ſorts of people; and looke almoſt how many men, ſo many minds, ſo many factions and oppoſitions betwixt ſometimes Biſhop and Miniſter, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and people, and (if it may be) more vnkindly and vnſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contentions amongſt vs. Inſomuch as ſome amongſt vs haue beene noted as men of another Church, although they were in the compaſſe of one Deanry, yea two of the next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, yea the ſame pariſh &amp; houſhold many times: the one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and vſing the Croſſe, kneeling at the Communion, and ſuch like; the other cleane contrary, euen condemning all other that are not of their owne opinion.

Laſtly to end this reaſon drawne from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the poore people (which is very eagerly and earneſtly vrged by theſe refuſers to ſubſcribe, in another caſe, againſt many indifferent ceremonies of our Church) I doe not ſee, in reſpect of this matter of offence and publique peace for poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick proceeding, but that we may as well admit diuerſities of religions, as they are now diuerſly diſtinguiſhed in the world (I meane euermore Chriſtian religion) as ſuch diuerſities in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about many particulars in any kind of religion, and proceeding for the profeſſion and expreſſing the ſame to God and the world: eſpecially towards the ſimple multitude (in the ordering whereof ſtandeth the greateſt ſkill,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. v. 2.

For beſides that this were many waies more ſafe for their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and would cut off many lets and hinderances (which on the other ſide are caſt into the way of the manifold dueties of their ſpeciall callings) it would very well become men of their ſort to haue ſo reuerent an opinion of ſo many waighty and graue conſtitutions, deuiſed and appointed by ſo many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heads, after ſuch long experience and precedents from all Churches in the world, to yeelde themſelues with heart and hand, and to giue their good allowance to the ſame, that at the leaſt they are lawfull and wholſome, and ſuch as doe no way croſſe and contrary the word of God.

For the other reaſon, that they doe dayly ſubſcribe by word and practiſe, how els doe they ſay Amen to our Leitourgies, and to our orders of common praier, whereat they refuſe not to be preſent, much more how can they be content by their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to haue liued as miniſters hitherto vnder that gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and particulars therein, to which now they dare not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and ſet their hands? whereas by their former practiſes they had done ſo many a yeare together, and ſo would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by their word and profeſſion now, but that ſome other ſiniſter cauſes (I feare) draweth and haleth them another way. And ſo to conclude this point, I deſire all to remember that wiſe ſpeech of that graue Senator in <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying of Rome, that then ſhould be the end of that Empire when the ſuperiors ſhould forget to rule as beſeemed them, and inferiors to obey in all things; which doth euermore beſt become them, and without the which there would be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Nomadum vita,</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19012:42"/> their ſide) make as much for vniformity in profeſſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſame religion by one kind of ceremonies and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances accordingly. And be it well conſidered and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in matter and weight of ſtate deliberation and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will be found thereupon, by all that are truely able to diſcerne ſuch matters and myſteries that it is as like to haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration &amp; multitudes of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which all kinds of opinion ſo much condemne) as ſuch variety, diuerſities, and contrariety in the outward manner, externall rites, circumſtances and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to expreſſe the ſame (as we haue aboue intimated) and in the outward performing thereof. And albeit there be great ods in reſpect of the matter of conſcience with GOD (which is but one, and ſo will haue but one religion, one faith, one baptiſme, &amp;c) and ſo for the ſoules and ſafeties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people which can haue but one good and true religion; yet for good policy, matter &amp; meanes of common peace, and well ordering the outward gouernment of the Church, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences may well and wiſely be obſerued to proceede from the latter then the former: as in comparing ceremonies with doctrine by certaine reaſons drawne from maſter <hi>Luther</hi> and others, we haue elſewhere ſhewed in a more large treatiſe, which if God pleaſe ſhall not be long behind this, about this and many other matters: the people being led chiefly by the outward ſenſes, and orders cuſtomably obſerued. Laſtly, whereas ſome obiect that our doctrine and ceremonies are contrary the one to the other, and that willingly (which all confeſſe and yeeld vnto) they would ſubſcribe to our doctrine and all the Articles of our faith, but not vnto the ceremonies; it ſeemeth to me very ſtrange, and much repugnant to the rules of true Diuinity; which teache that euermore to be good for practiſe, which is true and ſound for conſcience and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now our doctrine being allowed for good and currant (which doubtleſſe is as well about ceremonies, as any other head and point of doctrine) I cannot ſee any iuſt cauſe for the ſtanding out againſt the one more then the other: and indeed howſoeuer the doctrine of faith (which is according to thoſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19012:43"/> grand rules of faith and manners, as <hi>Hierome</hi> defineth them: 1. <hi>Tim. cap.</hi> 4) is truely and ſoundly taught and maintained, all other things about circumſtances and ceremonies, and ſpeciall practiſes of any, not contrary to the generall rules aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, cannot goe amiſſe, according to that graue and true iudgement of <hi>Auguſtin: Lib. de Ciuit. Dei cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Vbi bene creditur non male viuitur:</hi> And for things doubtfull and controuerſed (which euermore will remaine in the beſt reformed Church whatſoeuer) either for doctrine or practiſe, the Decrees of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſpeciall Church for their times ought to preuaile with euery well minded and affected perſon to God &amp; his Church. For the further reſoluing and concluding whereof, and this whole treatiſe, I deſire all to reade that which <hi>Melancton</hi> hath ſet downe, pag. 501. and 502: of the firſt part of his theological Councels, part whereof I haue thought fit and neceſſary to ſet downe and adde as a Colophonem to all the reſt: <hi>Haec cum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituta ſunt in Eccleſia, poteſtatem eſſe interpretandi ambigua, eam<expan>

For the clearing of which exceptions, and ſatisfying the offended therewith, I could commend many things out of ancient writers, and learned diſcuſſers of this point, and more eſpecially that anſwer of learned <hi>Caſſander</hi> (albeit in ſome things iuſtly to be refuſed) to ſeuerall obiections made againſt the ceremonies in baptiſme, vſed by moſt Churches, and the ſolemne adminiſtration thereof; but becauſe no authority of

For the which this poſition is in the firſt place to be ſet downe, (as to which all ſorts of Chriſtian profeſſors in the world haue euermore agreed and ſubſcribed) vntill of late ſome bold ſpirits (which dare ſet vpon any thing) haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered this grand poſition and Maxime in all ſtate procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; namely, that there is no nation of Chriſtian name ſo barbarous, but that in the adminiſtration of their baptiſme publique or priuate, ſome decent rites and ceremonies ſeruing for orderly and comely performing of the ſame, haue beene inuented, vſed, and retained by them, ouer and beſides ſuch things as are directly preſcribed for the adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by holy ſcriptures. As <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiecteth (and we neuer denied) to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>

Inſomuch as the great obſeruer of ſtate-proceedings, aſwell Ciuill, as eſpecially Eccleſiaſticall, <hi>Melancton</hi> wrote theſe words with great aduice no doubt, to one <hi>Loneras</hi> a very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous exceptor, and ſeuere and haſty cenſurer of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches: <hi>Nunquam poterit eſſe tranquillitas niſi in ritibus

And therefore as the Schooles ſay well, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances doe cloath the humane actions for the morality thereof (be they good or bad,) ſo outward rites and ſeemly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies giue the beauty &amp; true decency to the ſame. Which being moſt requiſite in all publiques for their better grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their grauity, and auoyding all contempt (which otherwiſe doth eaſily follow ſuch proceedings) ſo moſt of all in Gods ſeruice: whoſe houſe and euery the leaſt meanes of his preſence with vs, and our dealing with him, holyneſſe becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for euer, and all decency is too little. In which reſpect the Apoſtle himſelfe doth not only leaue it arbitrarie to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo to other Churches, to doe and ſee all things done in comelineſſe and order; much leſſe directeth and preſcribeth thereby, how things already preciſely and particularly commanded in the word for euery circumſtance and euery ceremony, ought to be mannaged and performed (as ſome of late are bould to interpret and define the meaning of the words to be ſo, and no otherwiſe:) but indeed, as the text ſheweth, and common reaſon conuinceth, commandeth and enioyneth the gouernors of that Church, and ſo of euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, to appoint and ordaine all ſuch things, as by the iudgement of ſuch gouernours (and not of euery priuate humor or fancy) might beſt make for the comely ordering all things in publique, performable to God: as alſo for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt edifying of the whole Church firſt, and then of euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member thereof. Implying that without ceremonies and outward accomplements, there were no comlineſſe in any of our actions: which without, the ſame were like bare walles without any ſeeling, varniſh, or painting. Secondly that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order, this colour and beauty of ceremonies, is no better
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19012:45"/> then a fayre face or ſweete complexion with a moſt miſhapen and monſtrous body. Laſtly all ſuch meanes, be they neuer ſo ſeemly and ſo orderly, are little worth, vnleſſe they be referred to edification the end of all: no more then a ſweet ſauour, and moſt comely proportion do profit one that hath an Atrophia, or hectick feauer and conſumption in his bones, that no one part can doe his office or right vſe for the good of the whole body. For indeed to ſpeake with the Apoſtle, doth not very nature, common reaſon and experience teache that (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> long ſince obſerued) no ſpeciall rules can euer be giuen (I may ſay with truth and reuerence) by God or man in writing,<note place="margin">In the ſixt book of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks.</note> or any other meanes of direction? whereby this comlineſſe and good order for edification may generally be giuen for all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which are infinite and accordingly continually prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, for all times, Countries, Churches, and congregations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) but that which is thought and is comely in one, and ſo may ſerue for order, and edifying to the ſame, is not ſo, nor can be ſo to another: beſides that as the Apoſtle ſaith, we haue no ſuch cuſtome,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.16.</note> which many times in any politick body becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth another nature (as we ſay) as well as in the ſtate of any naturall body.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow in the ſecond place, this poſition I hope ſhall be found and allowed to be as true, that not only amongſt the tolerable &amp; conuenient, but moſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, orderly, and edifying ceremonies of the Church, the ſigne of the Croſſe in ſpeciall may very lawfully and ſafelie be reckoned and eſteemed. The truth whereof may thus appeare, firſt becauſe the vſe of it in baptiſme (as it is amongſt vs) is not againſt any ſpeciall commandement of God, by which all our actions and particulars in vſe are to be examined, iuſtified, or condemned. Secondly, becauſe it is very agreeable to comely order, both generally, and more ſpeciall for the matter of baptiſme, and ſo conſequently very fit and profitable, and in ſome caſes alſo neceſſary for the edification of the Church. Laſtly becauſe the vſe of it hath beene very ancient and conſtant, euen in the matter of religion, in that ſenſe we vnderſtand it and expound it, throughout the Church of God, and thereupon alſo adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and commanded the rather to be retained of our Church and many beſt reformed Churches in the world. For the firſt (becauſe for the anſwering of the obiections which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of this treatiſe, it will better appeare) I will be the briefer in it: and only ſhew that it is neither againſt the firſt, ſecond, or third commandements; but eſpecially the ſecond, which this Croſſe ſo much croſſeth (if theſe mens iudgements might goe for authenticall expoſitions of that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And indeed that which wiſe <hi>Socrates</hi> (who diued as far as natures light and ſtrength could giue him, into the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold depths of thoſe two generall differences, <hi>bonum</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19012:46"/> perceiued to be the hardeſt taske for all thoſe Doctors to diſtinguiſh of good and euill, may more truely be auerred of our Diuinity Maſters, who for want of looking right into this perfect Lawe of liberty, which with the Euangelicall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony are the hardeſt taſkes of our profeſſion, put very often euill for good, and good for euill; and ſo are ſo farre to ſeeke in the right aſſoyling ſo many weake ones in caſes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as that they not only wound themſelues, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">Prou. cap. 17. verſ. 15.</note> through their peremptory aſſertions and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in caſes very doubtfull and difficult; but contrary to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> rule, iuſtifie the wicked and condemne the innocent, which both together are abhominable. Inſomuch as ſome worthy Diuines hold yet opinion, that all errors, ſchiſmes and hereſies in the world haue ſtill proceeded from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and miſconceiuing and conſtruing of the nature &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of God and ſinne diſcouered in this law. Now of thoſe three commandements, the firſt concerneth the hauing and worſhipping of the true God, and none other; the ſecond, all meanes to conceiue of him and ſerue him by: and the third, the manner how to vſe theſe meanes, and to haue and ſerue this God aright thereby. If therefore the vſe of the Croſſe do neither incounter nor incumber any of theſe three, the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will ſurely grant, that it is ſimply and in it ſelfe neyther againſt theſe, nor any other commandement of God. For the firſt, our doctrine neuer teacheth nor alloweth any of the leaſt part of worſhip any way to belong to the beſt creature, much leſſe to any image of this Croſſe, which is but a bare ſigne, and of no good thing in it ſelfe, but of a forme and ſigne made for ſuch a tormenting engine (which yet by accident became through Gods permiſſion a meanes of the beſt things and all good vnto vs) howſoeuer it be taken in wood, ſtone or met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, much leſſe conceited in the mind, or imagined by any fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by meanes of any tranſient and aërious ſigne as ours is. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt the vſe of a thing, much leſſe any part of the Church of God thereupon in their doctrine or practiſe, be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for any particular or accidentall abuſe of this Ctoſſe, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19012:47"/> any other ceremony, ſo long as the nature of the thing remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth indifferent, and the receiued and maintained doctrine of that Church is againſt them. For ſo do we teach, and ſo ought all both miniſters and people to beleeue deteſting all doctrine and abuſes to the contrary, that this our Croſſe either mental, aiërous, or expreſſed in any viſible forme, is ſo far from hauing any Diuine power in it naturally, (which is the higheſt idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) or transfuſed from Chriſt and the Croſſe which he hanged vpon, and ſo into all other Croſſes accordingly (which is a peeuiſh conceit of the Papiſts amongſt the reſt) or els infuſed by any eſpecial promiſe or grace of God, either into the thing it ſelfe, or vpon the beſt vſe of it, according to the ſolemne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of any Church to that end, whereby it hath any power to procure good, or turne away euill (which many hereticks and idolaters haue giuen vnto it,<note place="margin">Irenaeus lib. 10. cap 24. de Gnoſticis &amp; Carpocratianis</note> and doe yet at this day) but only hold it to be a bare ceremony inuented by man for other good vſes in the Church. And for the ſecond commandement we teache and hold in like manner, that this Croſſe which we vſe in any kind or difference, is no meanes either to expreſſe or comprehend God, or any perſon of the Trinity in or vnder it (as thereby the better to ſerue them, which is the firſt thing prouided againſt in this commandement) nay yet to be any meanes at all of Gods worſhip, which ought only to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by himſelfe, and therefore giueth commandement thereunto, and to the obſeruers thereof; who thereby doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vnto God, and procure bleſſings and good things to themſelues, which is the ſecond thing enioyned by the ſame, and the very ſumme of cautions giuen touching Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in this ſecond commandement: onely our Church retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it as an indifferent ceremony, as Maſter <hi>Fulke</hi> alſo in the like caſe anſwereth to <hi>Marſhalls</hi> reply againſt Maſter <hi>Calfield</hi> about this matter for the vſe of this Croſſe in the primitiué Church.<note place="margin">In his anſwer to the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle pag. 173.</note> For the third none of the reformed Churches where this Croſſe is vſed, make it any part of the forme outward or inward, or els any meanes of the leaſt part of Gods worſhip, as if without it holy baptiſme were not rightly adminiſtred, or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19012:47"/> with it were in any reſpect of God, or any power or vſe of the Sacrament the better thereby adminiſtred (all which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre ſome breach of the third commandement) but as our Canons explaine themſelues, the whole matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the whole ſubſtance, matter,<note place="margin">Second reaſon.</note> forme and manner thereof is perfected and ended before any vſe thereof bee once admitted or named: For the ſecond reaſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the lawfulneſſe of this ceremony, it appeareth from hence, becauſe it is very fit and agreeable to the three generall rules preſcribed by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for all ceremonies to be vſed in the Church, namely edification, comlineſſe and order. As for the latter two, to be comely and orderly, the iudgement, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and common vſe thereof by any Church, doe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently argue the ſame, in reſpect that this ſigne of the Croſſe (as aboue ſhewed) is as comely, and indeed more fit for the ceremonies of Baptiſme then any other. And is not only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally commanded, and that aboue other ceremonies, as being of moſt auncient vſe in moſt of the Churches in the world, &amp; ſo iudged more befitting this comlineſſe: but for order ſake, and auoiding confuſion, and many other ſcandals by name of ceremonies (which diſordered perſons of all ſorts would daily bring into the Church) is particularly retained, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and continuall vſe thereof ſo preciſely vrged and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amongſt vs by the gouernors of our Church. So that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of theſe two, comelineſſe and order, we do not deny but that any other ſuch like ceremonies were euery way as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in caſe they were as particularly commanded, and as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally vſed in the Church of God: in the which, vſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution giue as it were both matter and forme to all ſuch ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. But for the firſt of theſe three wherein we auouche that this Croſſe may ſerue for edification, it haply containeth more difficulty, and I am ſure moſt of thoſe enemies to this Croſſe of Chriſt, doe with both hands and heeles fight and ſpurne againſt it. Which yet I preſume may as eaſily be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as the other: as firſt of all becauſe it repreſenteth and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to our minds that ſpeciall meanes of Chriſt his abaſement
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19012:48"/> and ſufferings, as by which more ſpecially aboue all other it pleaſed God and our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, to haue our peace procured, and all curſes to be taken away from vs through that one curſed kind of death. Inſomuch as the holy Ghoſt by the Prophets in the old Teſtament, and by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the new, eſpecially Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that Euangelicall trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet (as <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> often calleth him) ſeemeth very greatly to delight in the word, both by vſing it ſinecdochically for the whole matter and meanes of our redemption, as alſo giuing it a prerogatiue and power (reſpectiuely to the thing ſignified by it, and not to the Croſſe it ſelfe, much leſſe this the leaſt kind of ſigne of it) to worke and import all graces <hi>by it,</hi> and comfortable reioycing in vs:<note place="margin">Galath. 6. Fulke &amp; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins obſerue, as Bellarmine.</note> in reſpect whereof alſo it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Church from time to time hath made ſuch choiſe of it, and vſe alſo in moſt of their holy adminiſtrations. Secondly becauſe it helpeth our manifold weakneſſes and infirmities, as well for meanes of knowledge, as alſo helpes of memory: and therefore Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> and <hi>Zanchius</hi> alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him allow the very image and picture of Chriſt himſelfe, for the better learning and remembring the hiſtory of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and paſſions eſpecially: and yet both of them (I knowe not how) eſpecially maſter <hi>Zanchius</hi> in his poſthume writings, in which ſome Ghoſt oftentimes may be diſcerned to ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then himſelfe, are much oppoſite to the vſe of this Croſſe in Baptiſme: Howbeit it is cleere from that one commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (if there were none other) beſides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall equity of all Gods commandements eſpecially the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> together with the precedents and practiſes of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches euen vnder the Lawe, and before, but ſpecially ſince the time of greater liberty vnder the Goſpell; that the gouernors of euery Church not only may, but ought alſo to inuent and appoint ſundry decent and conuenient ceremonies, as may beſt ſerue for the edification of their ſeuerall Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vntn them; and that as well for the outward as inward ſenſes, for the ſtirring and mouing of affection by muſique, or ſuch like, helping the phantaſie, knowledge, iudgement,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19012:48"/> conſcience, or memory of man in any thing wherein they haue to deale with God; and ſo any Church, Maſter of Family, or priuate Chriſtian, may very lawfully ordaine any kinde of meanes naturall, or artificiall, wherein their owne manifold infirmities (which are euermore greateſt and ſo appeare in dealing with God) may the better be helped and ſupplied: &amp; that ſo far and no farther (which alwayes I deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by way of expoſition to the ſecond commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) as ſuch inuentions of men are referred to themſelues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and haue no reſpect primarily or directly to God and his ſeruice, as wherewith God may any way the rather be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or his ſeruice in reſpect of it ſelfe or any ſpeciall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meanes thereof, be thereby any one iot the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Neither can I (nor any other I thinke) ſee any reaſon at all, why by art and humane inuention thoſe many defects of ours may not as well be ſupplied and releeued, as by the meanes of naturall things created by God, or falling out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly by his prouidence. Which none of theſe Croſſers of our Church ceremonies doe miſlike: but rather teache and command from the obſeruation of the new yeare, new Moon, waſhing of the hands and ſuch like, to be put in mind of the waſhing of our hearts and newnes of life, which is the ſumme of all Chriſtian life and doctrine. Yea and that which is more, in the very vſe of baptiſme (which elſewhere alſo is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and cannot ſufficiently be vrged againſt theſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) man may inuent and appoint a ſignificant name, by their doctrine importing all the duties of Chriſtian profeſſion, (as Feare God, Repent, and ſuch like) which are now in vſe, and proper names of ſome liuing: and yet the whole Church ſhould not haue power to ordaine ceremonies to put vs in minde of theſe holy things and duties. Neither ſecondly why the Church vnder the Lawe (wherein ſhe had leaſt libertie for any ſuch inuentions, being vnder the Pedagogy and ſeuere diſcipline of that ceremoniall Lawe) might and did very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inuent ceremonies, the better to helpe them in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of repentance, by putting duſt and aſhes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heads,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19012:49"/> in token of their great humiliation, and that they deſerued to be vnder the earth; in their ſpeciall facts alſo and feaſts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, Dedication, or rather Reſtauration of the Temple, &amp;c. And that now when not only the greateſt liberty is purchaſed to the Church ſince Chriſt his death (and that for theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings eſpecially in all matters of ceremony: but alſo the ſelfe ſame power in good proportion of quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit not wholly equall, is now in the Church, which before the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Lawe it ſelfe did beare and carry with it) this liberty of the Church ſhould be ſo much incumbred and reſtrained by theſe new and hard maſters: as namely for that which <hi>Scalliger</hi> reporteth of a famous ceremony inuented and vſed by the Iewes in the celebrating their Paſſeouer,<note place="margin">In emendatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne temporis.</note> in which the Maſter of the family tooke a piece of bread, wrapt it in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, and after dipped it in vineger, or ſome other liquor, to the end that all might aske and further vnderſtand the myſtery of thoſe matters, with this long ſpeech and exhortation together: This is the bread of affliction which our Fathers did eat in the wilderneſſe, all that are willing let them come and eate of the Paſſeouer: all which were famous ceremonies of their owne inuention, and moſt ſignificant meanes of thoſe great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and yet I hope (as none yet euer durſt) theſe condemners of all humane inuentions in any part of Gods ſeruice, will not miſlike any of them. Neither yet laſtly doe I ſee it to be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then that which is dayly vſed by themſelues and all other in their ſermons, and ſhadowing moſt high and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things by ſimilitudes, Emblems, Hyeroglyphicks, or any kind of hypotipoſis (which yet in all formes of preaching are moſt common and familiar) as to expreſſe the myſterie and doctrine of the Trinity by a triangle (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did the ſoule) and ſuch like very many which were ſuperfluous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat,<note place="margin">In ſecundo lib. de Anima.</note> the matter being no otherwiſe then as he ſaid of a picture and poetry compared together, that <hi>Pictura</hi> was <hi>tacens poeſis,</hi> and <hi>poeſis loquens pictura.</hi> To which for a third reaſon, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of this Croſſe with ſome other things of more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular likeneſſe and proportion may be added, as that ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19012:49"/> of waſhing the feet. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13. by Chriſt himſelfe, women to be couered in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in token of ſubiection, and the wearing of white garments by thoſe that were lately abſolued, or lately receiued into the Church in token of their innocency, and pardon of their ſinnes: whereupon came that <hi>Dominica in albis</hi> yet retained in our Church, and haply the name of <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> vntill which time many did weare ſuch garments. And alſo the vſing of white ſheets after repentance profeſſed, and abſolution giuen by the Church; the picturing or painting of Death his head, or Death it ſelfe, to put vs in minde of mortality, or any other meanes for morall vertues to be learned or expreſſed, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> himſelfe alloweth.<note place="margin">De operibus Inutilibus cap. de Imaginibus.</note> And indeed before writing or Printing were in vſe, there was no other meanes for the helping of memory, or any other kinde of inſtruction for knowledge, or manners, but by ſignes and Pictures, as in all the Aegyptian Hieroglyphicks, and other meanes in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and yet writing began but from <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom God firſt taught (as it is very probably gathered) this ſkill by his owne practiſe in writing firſt the ten Tables; and the other of Printing but ſince our Fathers daies. So likewiſe the ſame <hi>Zanchius</hi> miſliketh not the painting of Chriſt his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, transfiguration and ſuch like, yea the very Image of Chriſt in ſome caſes, both which <hi>Melancthon</hi> concludeth by way of anſwer and councell (how a dumbe perſon might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Lords Supper) to be neceſſaty and not indifferent only for the inſtructing of ſuch perſons, thereby to help their iudgements, affections, and knowledge alſo towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of that Sacrament. Which being in ſome caſes law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and expedient at the leaſt (if not abſolutely neceſſary,<note place="margin">In Conſiliis theologicis. pag. 268.</note> becauſe as ſhall be more fully anſwered hereafter, no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can make or mar the morality of any thing to be good or bad) it cannot ſimply be wicked or vnlawfull, but if in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and at ſundry times, and in certaine perſons they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they cannot be eſſentially and in their owne nature euill; and if theſe be any way to be allowed, there is no reaſon that the Croſſe ſhould be by ſo many meanes refuſed and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

Namely to be ſuch as would argue it to be vtterly vnlawfull in it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euery way, or els reſpectiuely, and by accidentall abuſe and ſcandall thereupon, ſince firſt it hath beene deuiſed and vſed in the Church and Sacrament of Baptiſme. Of the firſt kind, the firſt and worſt of all I thinke is that ſtrange aſſertion broched by ſome of late ſort, but originally deriued from the Manichees, &amp; ſometimes but in a more ſcholer-like ſort &amp; cauſe taken vp by that learned <hi>Lutheran Illiricus;</hi> that nothing in the world
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19012:53"/> for choyce or vſe, and whole nature of it is indifferent to any: but either ſimply and particularly forbidden or commanded: and ſo not only the croſſe, but all other ceremonies inuented by man, and orders in ciuill things for any good vſe in the Church eſpecially, or common wealth, to be vtterly vnlawful. To which a double anſwer may be rendred: Firſt that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground of this kind of building is very ſandy &amp; vnſound, taking away, and euen aboliſhing the very nature of things and order of Gods creation: whereas the trueth is, both many actions of men, much more the quality and condition of ſome things in themſelues, are neither good nor bad; but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and ſo are left to mans choice or refuſall: ſo that if he do them, or do them not, vſe them or vſe them not, more or leſſe, no conſcience of ſinne (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeakes out of <hi>Augustine</hi>) can ariſe from them:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> ſuch are, to vſe or not to vſe this or that meate drinke or apparrell, which defile not the man, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this or that kind of recreation, and to doe the one and not the other, or none of them both oftner, or more ſeldome, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or leſſe while, and ſuch like. Yea in morall and will acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelues, to giue thus much or thus little to that man, rather then another, as acts of curteſie and gratuity, and ſuch like a thouſand &amp; Eccleſiaſticall alſo, as ſinging &amp; ceremonies more or leſſe.<note place="margin">In Opuſculis.</note> Inſomuch as ſome (and euen maſter <hi>Beza</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) not without good ſhew of trueth and reaſon for it, haue ſpoken and written the cleane contrary: and made all actions whatſoeuer in themſelues to be neither good nor bad, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: as the actes of the fouleſt ſinnes, murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in the matter of warre and extreme puniſhment: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall duties are then good, and therefore not ſimply wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, being once clothed with their due circumſtances (as the Schooles ſpeake) which make euery action good or bad.

Which point being ſomewhat nyce and eaſily drawne into abuſe, I wiſh ſhould very warily be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19012:53"/> and wiſely harkned vnto, for feare of that which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath ſhewed in ſome to caſt all hand ouer head as in <hi>Iob.</hi> 22. and <hi>Mala.</hi> 3. verſ. 14. and ſuch like: howbeit if their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be of any action already done, or any thing already vſed as being determined of before in our choice to any end, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with circumſtances neceſſarily following the ſame, then we ioyn with them againſt all indifferency, and the diſputation were very friuolous, and <hi>de non ente,</hi> as we ſay. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly we anſwer that in caſe ſuch expreſſe commandement were neceſſary for euery particular thing &amp; action, eſpecially in all matters of Gods ſeruice, there is ſufficient expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (as we haue aboue ſhewed) for this and other ceremonies to make them good and neceſſary alſo being once commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (<hi>ex neceſſitate mandati</hi> at the leaſt <hi>vt ſcholae</hi>) to be vſed; as namely that place in the Corinthians which chargeth the Church gouernors to ordaine all things tending to decencie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. v. 26. and 40. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together.</note> order and edifying in the church, and not only (as theſe newe Maſters would haue it) to ſee all things particularly expreſſed in the word to be done with ſuch decency and due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, according to the ſpeciall commandements of GOD herein, which were infinite, and ſo impoſſible; and anſwerably all vnder authority to obey and vſe the ſame, for otherwiſe a man might preache in his doublet and hoſe, or any other more diſguiſed apparell, for any thing is any where particularlie commanded or forbidden to the contrary. And as it is moſt credibly reported of one of theſe (rather wilfull then weake refuſers of our ceremonies) in Northhamptonſhire, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from horſeback in trauellers array, both preached the word and adminiſtred the Sacrament in thoſe riding habites, booted and ſpurd, all vgly and ſpattred, ſaying that all other fit behauiours were but ceremonies. And I maruaile what warrant theſe men haue for their Turkiſh gowns, prety kinds of ruffes and ſuch like many (which we no way condemne) more then we haue for the Surpliſe and Croſſe and other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, there being as much for this firſt argument and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other that follow to be ſaid againſt them, as againſt theſe;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19012:54"/> except only they are therefore leſſe warrantable, becauſe they are commanded by the Magiſtrate, and Chriſtian magiſtrate alſo, either whereof make them from being indifferent altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary. The ſecond reaſon to prooue them ſimply wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is in briefe thus much, that becauſe they are outward formes deuiſed by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe of religion, they are flatly againſt the ſecond commandement being indeed ſuch as in their kind are worſhipped, or at the leaſt made means of worſhip, as they ſay, and included in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning word in the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: Thou ſhalt not worſhip them, &amp;c: as whereby all vſe of religion is ſignified, and things vſed therein inuented by man whatſoeuer. For anſwer whereunto we haue alreadie aboue ſhewed what is forbidden according to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſcope of the word <hi>worſhip,</hi> or the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and word of God in generall. Where firſt it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that no other outward formes howſoeuer deuiſed by man to any vſe whatſoeuer, are any farther forbidden therein then as they are inuented or any way vſed to repreſent the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible God or any perſon of the Trinity, for their better conceiuing of them or worſhipping of them thereby: or els ſecondly to be any meanes of the ſame nature with the word, Sacrament, and ſuch like, wherby to worſhip and pleaſe God, &amp;c. for which God will certainly according to his word and promiſe bleſſe the vſers thereof. Now God forbid that our Croſſe or any other ceremonies ſhould haue any ſuch vſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or meaning in them, but only (as we ſaid before) at the moſt to ſtir, guide and direct vs, and our weakneſſe (beyond which, I meane our ſelues, they haue no vſe or conſideration at all toward religion) to the more zealous, feruent, decent and orderly performing any of our obſequies and ſeruices to God. And ſo to grant that by the word to worſhip, all religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is meant (which notwithſtanding is wholly contained in the firſt commandement) yet doth it no way touch this Croſſe, which hath no ſuch religious vſe in it, or any way allowed to be exerciſed and performed in any kind or leaſt degree by it: but only to be a memoratiue ſigne vnto vs to helpe our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19012:54"/> and a manifeſt and worthy argument to others eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt his enemies, how wee are not aſhamed of this his badge and cogniſance,<note place="margin">In the Canons</note> ſo termed and accounted not vnfitlie of vs that vſe it: and hath not any reference at al to God either to expreſſe him by, or any of the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in Trinity, or to worſhip him therein, as any meanes thereof, which are the things that are only forbidden and condemned in the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not againſt the helpes of nature and art to ſupply mans wants and weakneſſe in dealing with God, &amp; in reſpect of any duety to be performed by him, which in all ages had been and muſt needs be inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and appointed for the dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, orderly, and more powerfull and liuely performing any duty to God or man.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon to ſhew it moſt wicked, is becauſe the thing it ſelfe is worſhipped and ſo is Idolatrous (as ſome except) or at the leaſt, the vſe of it and other ceremonies, as the beſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died of them haue obiected, is diuine worſhip. Which if it be true, both are flatly againſt the firſt commaundement in the higheſt degree, which forbiddeth any thing to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped but the onely true God, and all kinds, parts and manners of worſhip inward or outward to be giuen to any but to him only; and ſo alſo againſt the ſecond commandement inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and condemning all kinds and meanes of worſhip, but ſuch as himſelfe ſhall appoint and allow, whereof the Croſſe and all ſuch ceremonies we al confeſſe are none. But to anſwer this argument, if the firſt were true (I durſt confidently ſay) we had no true Church at all, or at the leaſt any ſound but a moſt ſicke one <hi>(vt Morneus de Romana)</hi> that ſhold maintaine by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practiſe ſuch damnable Idolatry:<note place="margin">In his counſels and godly Letters.</note> which was euer the cauſe of diuorce betwixt God and his old people, I meane for GOD his giuing them ouer to ſtrange iudgements, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Greenham</hi> that godly and wiſe man well obſerued. And it is a wonder (as our wiſe Soueraigne of late anſwered ſome of them) that hauing ſuch an opinion of our Church and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they ſhould endure to ſtay ſo long in it. And for the ſecond, we flatly deny the vſe of the Croſſe or any other to be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19012:55"/> in any ſence diuine worſhip, or any part of it, yea or ſo much as any way properly belonging to the eſſence and nature of it, or neceſſarily required to it, or in it: as if either the doing of it were a thing or action proceeding from vs, pleaſing or honoring God withall, or ſo much as any ſigne vſed by vs to teſtifie any part of our worſhip to God, or to declare the ſame thereby vnto men. For then indeede it were meere will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſuch as for which God would rather many waies curſe vs then bleſſe vs at all, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. and 2. <hi>Coloſſi:</hi> Nay we make it not ſo much as the leaſt meanes of God his worſhip, which were certainly euill and forbidden by the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. And whereas it is further obiected to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that theſe ceremonies are therefore diuine worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the legall ceremonies were diuine worſhip, being euery way of the ſame nature; I anſwer firſt, that no Diuinity can make it good that any ceremony legall or Euangelicall (neuer ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, is in any ſenſe to be called worſhip, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for any part of it (both which belong to the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement) all worſhip being ſome kind of action inward or outward, from the inferior to the ſuperior: whereas the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law it ſelfe, are cleane of another nature, being at the moſt none other then meanes, or rather helpes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God for thoſe times, for the more eaſie ſeruing of him, and keeping that ſtubborne people vnder the yoake of that pedagogy, when the Church was yet in her infancy; and ſo the true conſideration of them, their nature, and vſe is vnder the ſecond commandement.</p>
               <p>Secondly we anſwer that the legall ceremonies and thoſe wee ſpeake of, differ as farre as the two Sacraments of the Goſpell from all other holy ſignes and repreſentations of holy things; for as the word of commandement and promiſe maketh them Sacraments, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, and ſo meanes of Gods worſhip and certaine good things to our ſelues: ſo all other deuoide of that word promiſing aſwell as commanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine matters of another nature, and doe indeed differ eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, which is as we ſay in Schooles, <hi>genere &amp; definitione:</hi> So
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19012:55"/> that if we would define thoſe ceremonies and Sacraments, we muſt giue them a Genus aequiuocal from this commandement of GOD, as whoſe nature is in this kind of our conceiuing them now altered to be indeed ordinances of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> as <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. and <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. whereas the other are only actions of men, or things inuented &amp; made choice of by them, and ſo remaine for their proper notion and terme to my mind; howſoeuer ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to holy vſes by them that haue authority to ſeparate and determine things to ſuch vſes, who haue no kind of power to make ſuch ordinances being only to be appointed by GOD, as the ſecond commandement prouideth. Neither are ill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Gods worſhip, or whereby God is better worſhipped by vs (much leſſe ſignes, helpes and meanes therein) preſently the worſhip of God it ſelfe; neither yet are all ceremonies acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but whether they be actions, geſtures, or any outward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites ordained and appointed only by man, they are no other but helpes only; howbeit commanded once by God as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ceremonies were, the beſt and greateſt of them are but meanes and helpes whereby the better and more eaſily to worſhip GOD by; and in thoſe ſuch meanes as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed priuately or publiquely with any power, faculty or action of body or ſoule, which are the ſole and all the parts of Gods worſhip from man. And laſtly I conclude this anſwer, that theſe ceremonies we ſpeake of, are neither in themſelues worſhip of God, or any meanes thereof, nor yet any ſtrange manner of ſeruing God, ſo often condemned in holy Scripture, with that determination herein of <hi>Georgius Caſſander</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to one that carped at and condemned all ceremonies vſed in baptiſme.<note place="margin">In reſponſione ad obiectiones contra cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monias in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo vſitatas.</note> 
                  <hi>Alienus modus est colendi Deum qui vel pugnat cum vero culius, vel abducit a vero cultu Dei</hi> (which is a ſhort ſumme of things forbidden in the ſecond commandement) <hi>non qui eò inſtitutus eſt vt homines ad verum Dei cultum ducat, &amp; ad eius ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruationem informet.</hi> Nor any other meanes as helpes to our weakneſſe are forbidden by Chriſt in the fifteenth of <hi>Mathew</hi> vnder theſe words (In vaine doe they worſhip me,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. v. 9.</note> teaching for doctrines mens precepts or traditions) but onely ſuch as

                  </note> or at the leaſt ſome ſuch thing forbidden in that commandement, we will not (as indeed we need not) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their authority in this point; ſeeing as we haue aboue ſhewed, no ſuch kind of Images are any way forbidden by the true ſcope and meaning of that commandement in generall, or any particular word or clauſe contained therein, or any part of God his word; being no waies made, nor by any meanes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or defended to repreſent the Godhead or any perſon of the Trinity, or els to be any meanes at all for our better conceiuing or ſeruing any of them: much leſſe as to which the leaſt part of diuine worſhip inward or outward is or ought to be performed or applied, which the firſt commandement di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly prouideth againſt, and which I take it, is the ſumme of all our defenſes or replies vſed by any of our learned writers for the vſe or abuſe of the Croſſe, or againſt any kind of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. About which (I ſuppoſe) there would neuer haue bin ſuch hot and vnneceſſary contention betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt Churches of GOD in generall, if theſe things had beene tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly conſidered of, and the controuerſie it ſelfe (ſo farre as it may be ſo truely and in it owne nature termed) fully diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and determined. But becauſe I haue in the ſecond Chapter ſampled theſe things, together with many particulars of like nature, as namely one aboue the reſt to paint Deaths head, to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19012:56"/> put vs in mind of Death, and to prepare vs thereunto, would equally be found vnlawfull by their expoſitions and excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to write any thing in greater letters for better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of any part of Gods mercies and iudgements. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo the greatneſſe of the argument in generall doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue of it ſelfe, and through ſome more ſpeciall and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate traducements of my ſelfe by ſome more ſeuere cenſurers of my poore paynes hereabout in another kind (wherein I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to giue ſatisfaction to this argument) may happely vrge me to a more particular conſideration and diſcourſe about the ſame hereafter) I will leaue it for this time, and come to that other and laſt reaſon of this firſt ranke, arguing the vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Croſſe ſimply and in it owne nature: which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being with many other ceremonies moſt of them artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and of mans deuiſing, and withall Eccleſiaſticall, as we all grant, are yet notwithſtanding ſignificant to the Church of GOD, and of myſticall vſe, repreſentation and ſignification (there being no warrant or Scripture in particular or generall expreſly or by conſequence for any ſuch ceremonies.) To which becauſe I haue anſwered in a larger diſcourſe (which God willing ſhall not be long from the worlds cenſure) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in examining that cauil &amp; exception againſt our Church, how far foorth Matrimony ſignifieth the myſticall vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his Church (as is read in our ſolemnization thereof) I may be a little the briefer herein. The argument it ſelfe ſtanding vpon a very ſmall and weake foundation of all other. For theſe ceremonies firſt being enioyned and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by lawfull authority to a good end, without hereſie or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror thereabout in our doctrine, or ſuperſtition, or any kind of manifeſt impiety and pollution in our practiſing of them, we haue many waies ſufficient warrant for any of them in the word of GOD: neither are any of them done without, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Gods warrant and allowance by his word, as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of this point in our treatiſe before we haue ſhewed, being done to that generall end of all our actions in reſpect of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14: Whether we eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer els
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19012:57"/> we do (being matters as free for particulars in choyce and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and indifferent (as theſe ceremonies) doe them all to the glory of GOD,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.27. and 40. verſ.</note> and that other no leſſe generall in reſpects of men and the whole Church of God: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Let all things be done to edifying, comlineſſe and order: Inſomuch as we are ſo far from doubting, whether theſe things done in this manner and to theſe ends eſpecially, inioyned and commanded by lawfull authority, be pleaſing vnto God, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23: (ſo far foorth as things indifferent and of that nature are ſaid to pleaſe God) as that being omitted either by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in not appointing them, or by the ſubiect of any place by not obſeruing them, they are to be cenſured for manifeſt breaches of Gods commandement. Secondly to allow a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and not to be ſignificant, were to imagine a ſhadow without a ſubſtance; all of them being outward ſignes, and ſo neceſſarily ſignificant of ſome inward diſpoſition of the will affecting, ſhewing or expecting any thing: as <hi>Fulke</hi> againſt <hi>Sanders</hi> on the miſſals, and books that way written very many eſpecially by <hi>Durandus</hi> in his <hi>Rationali diuinorum</hi> (albeit ſome haue called it, and that not without reaſon for ſome things therein conteined, an vnreaſonable booke) may euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And that the Church of God hath in all ages lawfully and without any contradiction of God or man inuented and appointed ſuch ceremonies, the better to teſtifie their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and humiliation, for cauſe of ioy and thankſgiuing (which conteine in a manner the whole ſumme of mans duties to God) all the ceremonies vſed at faſts or feaſtes doe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to all the world, whereof that one is very memorable, not only in the feaſt of Purim it ſelfe, which was an inuention and appointment of the Church at that time, as well as many other which we haue aboue remembred, but one ſpeciall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony which the Iewes retaine vnto this day: which is, that whenſoeuer the name of <hi>Haman</hi> is repeated in the Scripture to be read on that Feſtiuall, all ſtand vp and beate the formes and ſeates with their hands and feete, for their generall better remembraunce of that great benefit of their deliuerance from

All which ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne no error or ſuperſtition in them, nay yet through ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity violate any wholſome conſtitution made to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor laſtly through nouelty and weakneſſe of iudgement, giue occaſion not onely of vnneceſſary ſcandall, and too too truly giuen, but alſo at ſometimes of ſcoffing and ſcorning to ſome profane ſpirits at ſuch holy myſteries (in which the leaſt action and geſture ought to carry a due reuerence, port and Maieſty) I thinke no man of vnderſtanding can iuſtly miſlike
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19012:58"/> them: Thirdly theſe men forget what a broad difference there is betweene ſundry kinds of ceremonies, which all notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are ſignificant, and can no otherwiſe be.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19012:59"/> To which (albeit vnworthy of any anſwer) being a groſſe and foule fallation <hi>ab ignoratione Elenchi</hi> (as we ſay) the argument being not <hi>ad idem:</hi> for this honorable mention of the Croſſe is not made by vs, becauſe it was a meanes of tormenting ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent a perſon (howſoeuer alſo not the inſtrument, but the deuiſers and actors of ſo wicked a practiſe, deſerue all the blame herein) but becauſe it pleaſed God to permit, and ſo it was effected in time, that his owne Sonne ſhould by ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a death (the better to declare the greatneſſe of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and his owne mercies) procure our peace.

Another argument of this latter kind, and to the ſame
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19012:59"/> purpoſe is thus framed: No inuention of man or ceremony whatſoeuer, whereof there is not for the preſent, nor yet euer hath beene any neceſſary vſe in the Church of God, being once abuſed, and that ſo generally, may any longer be vſed and reteined in any part or meanes of Gods ſeruice: but the Croſſe is for euery point ſuch a thing, therefore it ought no longer to be vſed in any reformed Church. To which I firſt anſwer,<note place="margin">Iohannes Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlinus Sebaſtian Franck, and one Entfelder. Anno 1543.</note> that by this argument all ceremonies whatſoeuer (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which the word of God ſpecifieth and particularly requireth) ſhould in time be all condemned, and caſt out of the Church: which was the opinion of ſome in Germany, as namely <hi>Iohannes Bunderlinus</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtiane Franck</hi> (who ſet foorth books <hi>Anno.</hi> 1530: condemning all ceremonies) yea euen the holy Sacraments themſelues: becauſe they had been prophaned, violated and oppreſſed (as they write) by the tyranny and Idolatry of Antichriſt. For ſo indeed it is cleere, that no humane inuention whatſoeuer, but hath either former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or may futurely be abuſed: and ſo by conſequence none to be reteined in ſequele of time and abuſe. So that any may perceiue the very foundation of this argument to be moſt vnſound, and contrary to the very rules of common reaſon, for that (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> truely teacheth) whatſoeuer is,<note place="margin">Ariſtot. Ethicks lib. 4. cap. 4.</note> or may be well vſed, may alſo be abuſed: and ſecondly, no abuſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing can take away the right and true vſe thereof; for then as the Apoſtle ſaith in another ſuch like caſe we ſhould goe out of the world. And laſtly nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be abuſed which hath not firſt of all been in ſome good vſe or at the leaſt appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> the abuſe being a priuatiue or a negatiue at the leaſt of the other; and ſo no doubt was this Croſſe before (as we haue aboue remembred out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) the Gnoſticks and other hereticks had ſo anciently abuſed the ſame: and more particularly the ſanctified Bells ſo called and vſed in Poperie, &amp; in moſt of our Churches yet reteined, our Fonts alſo which haue been as fouly abuſed, to ſpeake nothing of our feaſtes (wherein much Idolatry and fooliſh worſhip hath been giuen to Saints diuers waies) ſhould all be remoued, if this argument
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19012:60"/> were good, there being no ſuch abſolute neceſſity for any of them, beſides the commandement of lawfull authority which for decency, order, and better edification appointeth the ſame rather then any thing els. For ſo we ſee that (as ſome haply vpon conſcience of this matter and argument we haue in hand, haue made a common practiſe of it) children might otherwiſe be baptized at ſome baſon, or ſome riuer and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of water, as <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did. And for the braſen Serpent (about which there hath been ſo much adoe betwixt <hi>Martiall</hi> and <hi>Calfill, Fulke</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> euen in this very argument of the Croſſe) there is no queſtion but that it was very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed before <hi>Hezechias</hi> his time: and yet did not any of the Kings before him pull it downe, nor any of the Prophets of thoſe times did call vpon them ſo to doe; much leſſe (as ſome of theſe new maſters enioyne Chriſtian princes) were any of thoſe Princes bound vpon feare of that Serpent ſo to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or giuing occaſion to Idolatry (which could not bee but very great,<note place="margin">2. of Kings. cap. 28. v. 4. &amp; 2.

And laſtly, the ſetting vp of the Image or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of any ones father or friend (which is a thing in my poore opinion too too common in ſome other reſpect, euen in the places where all the parts of our holy ſeruices are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as alſo the armes and pictures of Princes, which is as common in many Churches, might with greater ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be called into queſtion (if there were any force in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) then our Croſſe, which is but aërious, and a tranſient

Which alſo haue not only beene abuſed to the greateſt ſuperſtition and Idolatry (as appeareth by all ſtorie) but alſo the very firſt occaſions and originalls of all Idolatry, as out of the 14. of the booke of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> partly appeareth, and many learned men haue gathered from thence, and how the pictures of princes haue bin by the flattery of Sycophants, their owne pride and cruelty abuſed this way, many hiſtories report. And yet I hope for theſe abuſes, cauſes, or occaſions thereof (then the which there can be no greater) none will be ſo bold, not onely for feare of law in that caſe prouided, but euen vpon conſcience of due reuerence to the ſame, as to pull them downe, or conclude that they ought to be pulled down: or any way deface them, or diſgrace them by word or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly (whereas they obiect that there is no neceſſarie vſe of this Croſſe in the Church of God) I aunſwer that it is enough for vs, and might be for them alſo (but that nothing can hold them) to make it neceſſary, becauſe the Church of Chriſt hath ſo aunciently vſed it, and the preſent Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment iudgeth it ſtill fit to be reteined amongſt vs: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any priuate ſpirit to call that common, prophane, or vnneceſſary (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſometimes was aduertiſed) which GOD by his lawfull Magiſtrate hath made holy and neceſſary to be performed by vs.<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> Neither yet can any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall abuſe, albeit in the higheſt degree of any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer neceſſary or indifferent, diſcharge the ſubiect from his due obedience to things of this nature once commanded by the Magiſtrate. Which if it ſhould be granted and yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, many temporall Lawes of this kingdome (which are forced to tolerate many a miſchiefe oftentime) ought eftſoones to be repealed. Thirdly, beſides that there haue been, and yet are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many good and ſo neceſſary vſes of this Croſſe (as we haue formerly proued) ſo is there no better way to ſhew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the abuſes of the ſame,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> then that both by preaching (which I could wiſh were more carefully performed in this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19012:61"/> behalfe) and due vſe and practiſing the ſame in the publique congregation, all ſorts of people might be informed in the trueth and lawfulneſſe of this ceremony by Gods word. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thoſe places which are alledged out of <hi>Exodus, Eſai,</hi> and <hi>Hoſea,</hi> to ſtrengthen this argument; I anſwer, that moſt of them are particular caſes grounded vpon ſpeciall circumſtances of thoſe peoples ſinnes, and ſo are not to be drawne to conclude any generall propoſition for, or againſt theſe kind of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: as for example there is great odds betweene the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> where all ſuch meanes and monuments of Idolatry are in particular commanded vtterly to be defaced, and any part of the Church of GOD, in which any ſuch abuſe hath ſometimes hapned or more conſtantly beene continued, for which God neuer gaue any peremptory and generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement or ſpeciall charge againſt them. Secondly thoſe places in <hi>Eſai</hi> and <hi>Hoſea</hi> are threatnings and promiſes of God to his Church,<note place="margin">Eſay. 30. Hoſea. 2.</note> for the better informing, ordering, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame, and in no reaſonable conſtruction or expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any peremptory commandements againſt the things there ſpoken of: as where it is ſaid, I will pollute their Images, and cauſe the name of <hi>Baall</hi> to ceaſe, the one being a iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced againſt the Idolatry of that time (which God be thanked is farre from vs and our ſtate, which maketh ſeuere lawes for the puniſhment of the ſame) the other a gratious promiſe, as the ſcope of that place and the meaning of the words declare. And what a deale of Sophiſtry is committed by allegation of Scripture, any Iudicious text-man or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the many ſtrange concluſions of theſe times may eaſily perceiue, and elſewhere my ſelfe haue giuen ſome touch vnto them, and taſt vnto other: becauſe indeed (which is diligently to be marked for the true vnderſtanding of many Scriptures) many things are ſpoken therein eſpecially in their Sermons <hi>cohortatorie</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> obſerueth in the Fathers) that is,<note place="margin">2. 2. quaeſt. de vſura.</note> by way of exhortation and <hi>maiorem cantelam</hi> (as <hi>Caietanus</hi> alſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in the Schooles themſelues) wherein things are applyed to the times preſent, and not any way determined of for the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19012:61"/> lawfulneſſe or vnlawfulneſſe thereof, and ſo ſuch promiſes and threatnings implying alwayes a condition, doe put nothing in being, as the Schooles ſpeake, which is alwaies to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and only to be iudged by the rule and Canon of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lawe: of which nature alſo are certaine homilies of ours from which theſe exceptors thinke they haue ſo great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as well for not ſubſcribing thereunto, as for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing this matter of the Croſſe which we haue in hand. Beſides alſo that many things are by compariſon and ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically drawne by theſe diſputers from the olde Teſtament to the new: and ſo as the ſchooles ſay, <hi>argumenta ſymbolica &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiua,</hi> are <hi>parum argumentatiua,</hi> little or norhing at all able to conclude any thing: whereas thoſe godly exhortations are made (as the title of them ſheweth) againſt the perill of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and by way of greater deteſtation, and not according to their particular iudgement what is lawfull or forbidden there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the preciſe rule of Gods word. Laſtly theſe men greatly wrong themſelues, as well as our whole Church and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors thereof, in comparing that abominable Idoll of <hi>Baall</hi> and the reſt aboue mentioned in thoſe Scriptures, with our Croſſe, and other ſuch like ceremonies, howſoeuer defiled with much ſuperſtition and Idolatry at any time: for as for that one of <hi>Baal,</hi> and moſt alſo of the other, there neuer was, nor poſſibly could be any good vſe of them, as we haue ſhewed and prooued of the Croſſe. Neither was the naming of thoſe abominable Idols ſimply wicked (as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> alſo diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in one of his Epiſtles, and which might well fit our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt in this kind, who cannot abide the leaſt mention of the Maſſe, and that vpon conſcience of theſe places, which yet was generally vſed, as Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> ſheweth,<note place="margin">Fulke againſt Sanders.</note> to ſignifie the Lords ſupper by it a long time in the Church) but ſuch a mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them only as thoſe Idolaters did vſe towards them, as may appeare by the contrary proteſtation of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſalm. 16: ſaying, I will not mention them in my lips, which is (as the ſcope of that ſpeciall place argueth) to praiſe them or pray vnto them, as it is well knowne the Idolaters did. Whereas
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19012:62"/> the worſt that euer was imputed or performed to this Croſſe, or any other of that nature, was no way giuen to the things themſelues, or by their meanes to any horrible Idoll, as that of <hi>Baall</hi> was, and ſo to the very diuell himſelfe (as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth) but reſpectiuely alwayes, and in relation to him that did hang vpon the Croſſe (as the worſt of them all chalenge for themſelues) as from whom by their idle fancies, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious imaginations ſome diuine power was communicated and transfuſed into that, and all other Croſſes; and that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (as the beſt of them plead for it) and themſelues) then as a King doth make a grant, and ſendeth vſually ſome token of his will and authority in many particulars by his ring or ſeale: and ſo much for this argument alſo.</p>

The firſt whereof (which toucheth Chriſtian liberty) ſauoreth not a little of Anabaptiſme, from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19012:62"/> which ſome writing maſters of this kind haue bought or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed too many drugges to make vp their poyſonfull confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in ſome of their books, as that other aboue, vſed by them againſt the indifferency of any thing, was drawne from the Manichees. Inſomuch as a man may boldly and truely ſay of many of theſe irregular perſons, for the ſumme of their new doctrines and ſtrange practiſes, that they are for the moſt part (and ſo will be found) to be compounded of Manichiſme and Anabaptiſme, I meane the worſt ſort of them: For againſt the other (which I haue elſewhere diſtinguiſhed) I neuer intended in this or any other to deale againſt them, but as neere as I can, the errors of them all. As in this one particular of withdrawing their obedience to lawfull authority in things in their owne nature indifferent, vnder colour of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liberty, doth very plainly appeare. In which (for more ſpeciall anſwer) they ſhew not only their great ſecurity in not examining their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for ſo manifeſt a breache of Gods Lawe, and their further pride &amp; hypocriſie in paſſing ouer the <hi>grauiora legis</hi> (as Chriſt told the Phariſies of his time) vnder colour and pretence of making ſcruples and conſcience of theſe ſmaller things (as comparatiuely they may be called) but alſo very groſſe and ſottiſh ignorance in not diſcerning,<note place="margin">Inſtitutionum lib.</note> nor any way determining aright of this Chriſtian liberty. Which is a thing indeed (as <hi>Caluin</hi> well obſerueth, and diſcourſeth vpon this argument) no leſſe ſpirituall then the pardon of ſinne, and peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and ſpecially conſiſteth in that ſpirituall freedome from the lawe of ſinne (and curſe awarded by Gods lawe thereupon) which naturally raigneth in our mortall bodies, that is, euery power and part of body and ſoule; and power from Chriſt his grace, ſpirit and life, to worke righteouſneſſe and fulfill the law: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from the laſt words of the 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to the end of the ſeuenth, moſt fully ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe. Neither did Chriſt come (as himſelfe proclaimeth) to deſtroy the Law, but to eſtabliſh and performe it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all his members: who is a Sauiour, but not to ſinne againe, a phyſition, but not to ſurfetting, and therefore hath
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19012:63"/> deliuered vs from all our enemies,<note place="margin">Lucae. 1.</note> that we ſhould ſerue him, and keepe euery one of his commandements. The maine ſumme whereof ſtandeth in due obedience to himſelfe, and his lawfull ordinances,<note place="margin">Zanch. in Confeſſ.</note> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> expoundeth the ſame. Neither doth our freedome from that ſeuerity of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Lawe abridge any whit the authority of the Magiſtrate in decent ceremonies agreeable to the Goſpell; but cleane contrary (as we haue aboue remembred) inueſteth rather that whole perfection, meaning, and authority of the ceremoniall Law in thoſe Chriſtian Magiſtrates, to whom God commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any part of his Church vnder the Goſpell. The ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law indeed being nothing els but an order appointed by God himſelfe for the outward policy and diſcipline of the Church being then vnder the pedagogy of the Law, which now is left to the liberty of Chriſtian Princes as they ſhall ſee their times &amp; occaſions to require. Only, <hi>vt Auſten, ne excedant</hi> and ſo become a ſnare and burden; where yet I ſee not but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is neceſſary, albeit <hi>(vt Peter)</hi> a yoake too heauy to beare, and it is a ſinne to the commanders encroching vpon this liberty: but yet you inferior muſt obey, and ſo (as <hi>Beza) bene parere,</hi> may and muſt ſtand when magiſtrates doe <hi>malè imperare.</hi> So if the Apoſtles had vrged more ceremonies, <hi>paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum orat: Secundo Cauendum ne (vt de Imaginis vſu) multitudo caeremoniarum</hi> hinder charity, or oppreſſe any in theſe poore times, and daies of Gods wrath vpon the Church, as alſo of the miſerie for the moſt part of the miniſtery and abundance of poore in all places. Thirdly diſpute not thou what is fit for diſcipline of Clergy or people, in ceremonies more or leſſe, theſe or other, but leaue it to the magiſtrate that is charged with that care, and muſt anſwer for his magiſtracy, and ſinnes thereof one day. Neither may any without great occaſion of ſinne, and manifeſt breach of the fift commandement, pulle their necks out of the yoake of their lawfull commands. For Chriſtianity taketh not away any part of ciuility or humanity (as ſome haue well ſaid) much leſſe due obedience to lawfull authority, as too many haue taught of late and practiſed. And
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19012:63"/> to conclude this firſt part of my anſwer to this obiection, I deſire all to reade and compare with iudgement that reply of our Sauiour Chriſt to that Phariſaicall exception againſt Chriſt his Diſciples for eating with vnwaſhen hands, with the doctrine and practiſes of theſe men, who making ſcruple and much adoe about Croſſe and Surplice, and a few ceremonies diſtaſting their priuate iudgements, runne headlong into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen neglect and contempt of the fift commandement. And ſo as the Phariſies did vpon error of deuotion and conſcience to their Corban, cauſe many a ſilly diſciple of theirs to neglect their manifold duties to father and mother, whereby (as Chriſt telleth them) they made the commandement of God of none effect by their traditions. Euen ſo doe theſe new maſters eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way the ſelfeſame in effect. Secondly I anſwer, that albeit no humane Lawes do of themſelues binde the conſcience, but only as they haue their ground and warrant from the fift commandement, and further, that no magiſtrate or creature in the world can take away the leaſt part of Chriſtian liberty in things inwardly ſpirituall, or outwardly indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for choice or vſe (becauſe Chriſtian liberty is the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſtill, and is ſeene as well in doing, as not doing, vſing or not vſing any thing ſubiect vnto it:) yet do all wiſe eſteemers of theſe things hold, that euery Chriſtian Magiſtrate may, and ought alſo many times by vertue of the fift commandement, reſtraine this Chriſtian liberty in many particular things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as any good cauſe and reaſon generall or particular, may occaſion any Prince or ſtate to make wholſome Lawes for any ſuch purpoſe. And that ſo farre, and ſo large, as no one commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God by commiſſion or omiſſion any thing hereby be preiudiced by any of theſe reſtraints or impoſitions whatſoeuer. As in the matter of faſting &amp; abſtinence, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Schooles haue fully determined; which may ſerue for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and direction touching all wholſome Lawes penall or otherwiſe enacted and in force, in our ſtate or any other.</p>

For anſwer whereunto I hope I ſhall not need to ſtand vpon the definition of a Scandall in generall,<note place="margin">Hieron. in 15. Math. v. 12.

I wiſh theſe great exceptors, and all other too too iuſtly ſcandalized by them, &amp; their offenſiue behauiours in this behalfe, to turne their eyes vpon the manifold ſcandalls and inconueniences alſo, which many waies breake out priuately and publiquely, both in Church and common wealth, by reaſon of their omitting, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking, and ſo peremptory condemning the vſe of the ſame, albeit eſtabliſhed by publique authority amongſt vs. Which indeed are ſo many, as that no wiſely affected or honeſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed heart can but throughly and moſt feelingly be touched and iuſtly greeued withall; eſpecially ſince thoſe which riſe from the omitting of it, are farre greater and of another nature from thoſe which proceede from the vſing of it, euen in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme it ſelfe, or any other holy adminiſtration, there beeing indeed betwixt them no iuſt or fit proportion or compariſon: the one being only paſſiue, and vnneceſſarily taken by thoſe that abuſe them, and themſelues and others by them: and doe neither know the truth, vſe, or right practiſe of them: the other being too too iuſtly giuen, and actiuely, and in themſelues euil

As namely generall diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and both inward and too too often outward kicking, ſpurning and rebelling againſt the moſt graue decrees and conſtitutions of the Church, and ſoueraigne authority of the chiefe Magiſtrate (to which euery honeſt heart ought willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to ſubſcribe and ſimply without contradiction or diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to yeeld their obedience.) Beſides the great neglecting of ſpeciall callings, and manifold duties therein to GOD and man, bereauing the Church alſo by this meanes of their gifts, and themſelues and others of their neceſſary maintenance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other, which I haue more griefe then will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate. Secondly, were theſe offences both alike, I meane acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally euill only, as thoſe taken herein are, and ſo being meere occaſions, <hi>nec dant ſpeciem, nec veniunt in definitione,</hi> as the Schooles ſpeake, 22. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 43. <hi>art.</hi> 1. and therefore are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſes of euill: yet in ſuch a conſideration, the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doth and ought with euery good conſcience to ouerſway the fewer and the leſſer, which if they ſhould be reckoned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there would appeare great oddes, and a broad diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any equall or iudicious eie. And whereas ſome haue found a more nice difference in this behalfe, in reſpect of the Magiſtrates commanding theſe things, which in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might well be forborne, charging them further with great want at the leaſt of Chriſtian charity, and wiſe louing care and foreſight towards the good of their poore ſubiects, and inferiors ſoules and bodies, by not preuenting and taking away ſo many cauſes, or to ſpeake more properly, occaſions of ſo much offence, hurt and dammage to their weake conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Church of God in generall: I anſwer firſt, that it is a horrible ſinne both againſt the fift, but eſpecially againſt the ninth commandement, for any priuate ſpirit or perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, to entertaine any ſuch thoughts and ſuſpitions (which are no other then diabolicall ſuggeſtions) againſt their Prince or any lawfull authority placed ouer them. Whereas the rule
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19012:65"/> of that royall law is particularly expreſſed in the ninth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, neuer to cenſure or conſter the words or doings of any the meaneſt offenſiuely and to the worſt, when any more fauourable conceipt and interpretation thereof may be admitted and affoorded. Much more to preſume ſo farre as to preſcribe any thing in this kind to thoſe, whoſe very thoughts they ought to honour euen in their owne ſecret thoughts, and priuy chambers: much more to reuerence and imbrace with all duety and reſpect, all their ſolemne ordinances and deſignments for any ſuch adminiſtration, for the which they are accountants to God only and none other. And therefore I ceaſe now to marueile, and rather begin to feare and tremble, at the moſt inſolent practiſes and behauiour of ſome in theſe daies, who not only dare to cenſure and miſdeeme by moſt vncharitable iudgement, the words, writings, and beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Sermons of the moſt conſiderate and zealous amongſt vs: but alſo feare not to enter into the very thoughts of Kings themſelues: whereas beſides religion, common charity, and ſpeciall allegiance, euen good manners might teach and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them other thoughts, words, and demeanour.

And then in things of this nature being indifferent, or ſomewhat more doubtfull to weake and vnſetled iudgements, to ſubmit themſelues, their iudgements and conſciences in all duety, reuerence and humility to theſe ſage, grand, and no doubt moſt conſcionable determinations of ſuch and ſo many as are both as holy (as the beſt of the ſtanders out) and more old and wiſe then their fathers (as he told <hi>Iob</hi>) who haue oftentimes conſidered, and doe yet (when theſe men haply ſleepe) maturely deliberate of theſe, and all ſuch occaſions, for the common peace and their ſpecial good, if they had eyes and grace to ſee it.</p>

Thirdly, I anſwer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe offences, with our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. Woe be to them by whom the offence commeth: which in this caſe can no way be imputed to the magiſtrate commanding, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his conſcience and ſpeciall duty to God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this behalfe, any ſuch ceremony for vniformity, godly edifying, and peace of that gouernment and body eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Ciuill whereof he is the head; much leſſe may it be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon the immediate miniſter and vſer of any ſuch cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, who is neceſſarily bound to doe the thing which his prince or any other lawfull authority require at his hands, and hath the ſame for his warrant; inſomuch as if haply any iuſt offence be giuen herein (to which any ſuch woe properly belongeth) it doth by all right and reaſon returne vppon the firſt commanders (who will not deny I am ſure to take the ſame vpon them) and by no equity vpon the heads of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ſouldiers, which are enioyned vppon iuſt penalties to doe that which their Captaines direct and appoint. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true cauſe of thoſe offences which haply ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come to paſſe, reſteth in them only who partly through weakneſſe and groſſe ignorance (which neuer excuſed any) and ſomtimes wilfulneſſe, pride, and malice, make offence in theſe things to themſelues and others (and therefore a more grieuous woe is due vnto them) when indeed there is no iuſt cauſe thereof any where to be found; who alſo might both perſwade themſelues and others, but that (as I may without breach of charity boldly affirme) they are ſo farre gone and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19012:66"/> departed from their due obedience in this kind (euen by a perpetuall rebellion as <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeaketh) as that they haue reſolued together with thoſe of whome the Poet <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſpeaketh, neuer to be perſwaded: although indeede they be perſwaded, and find in their conſciences that without any iuſt offence to GOD or man, they might ſafely doe any of theſe things. Laſtly, I anſwer that there is no better meanes to auoid and vtterly to take away theſe offences imagined, or truely giuen and ſo commonly taken by Papiſts, or any other in the vſe of the Croſſe or other ceremonies that are now adayes ſo generally diſtaſted, then when Chriſtian Princes commaund the true and right vſe of them, and the godly learned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery do by their preaching and vſing the ſame inſtruct all ſorts of people, both how to vſe them aright, and alſo to ſhunne the manifold abuſes and offences which haue fallen out thereupon in the world. Wherin if the learned miniſterie of this kingdome had beene as carefull and conſtant both in their doctrine and practiſe to obſerue this vniformity, not only in this ceremony of the Croſſe, but all other things for doctrine and manners, ſo wiſely and carefully agreed vppon and prouided in our Church: as the other are ouer diligent in the one by their daily teaching and dropping as it were into the minds of their followers ſo many drops of all thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes: and moſt reſolute in tying themſelues and all their ſectaries by the ſtricteſt ſubſcription (that euer I thinke was vrged) to the obſeruation of their orders and none other: we had long ſince ſeene an end of ſo many ſchiſmes and vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary differences and contentions amongſt vs about theſe <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiora legis</hi> (as I may terme them) of Croſſe, Surplice, and other ceremonies, and many times about meere trifles and moon-ſhine in the water: which yet haue much hindred many things appertaining to the weightier things of Gods Law, as mercy, peace, iudgement and righteouſneſſe, wherein the kingdome of God and the ſafety of his people conſiſteth: and many a poore ſoule, and otherwiſe loyall ſubiects, which now though ignorance, perplexity, tenderneſſe of conſcience, or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19012:67"/> any worſe cauſe feele the penalty of that lawe, whereof they might haue had the good and benefit (which is the proper end thereof) would neuer haue incurred ſo many ſcruples, ſnares, domages and daungers: wherewith their minds, goods, names, bodies, ſoules, and all are now entangled and much incombred, afflicted and oppreſſed. Whoſe eyes I pray God for Chriſt his ſake to open, and by the meanes and helpes of ſo many worthy <hi>Abners</hi> vnder our Soueraigne amongſt vs, to reduce all the true ſubiects and liege people of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome euen from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> vnto the moſt wiſe, bleſſed, and peaceable gouernement of our <hi>Dauid,</hi> by reaſon of our diuiſions yet remaining as it were in them: whom wee hope God hath annoynted &amp; eſtabliſhed with his poſterity to ſit vpon this throne, and raigne eftſoones ouer vs as in Ieruſalem for euer; when all the enemies of our peace and ſtate ſhall by his induſtry and godly wiſedome be brought to one vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and agreement in all points and articles of faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and a generall, true, conſtant, and continuall confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in Ceremonies, which onely is able to make our England <hi>Dauids</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 122. and all of vs with our poſteritie to ſee the peace of it all the dayes of our life, ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for euer.</p>
